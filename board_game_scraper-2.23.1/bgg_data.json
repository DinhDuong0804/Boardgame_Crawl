During this time, they brought stunning technological innovation and scientific advancements to their domain. This accelerated progression helped the Domineum reach \u2014 and eventually inhabit \u2014 even the farthest segments of the known galaxy, where new Houses emerged to govern the outer sectors of the empire. As the House of Novarchon grew in power, so grew the religious cult that surrounded them, proclaiming grim prophecies about an ancient cosmic being from another dimension: the Voidborn.\n\nMany thought it to be only a myth, but in truth, it was the Voidborn's dark influence that granted the Novarchs the sheer knowledge to achieve rapid expansion for the empire. While the cult of the Novarchs envisaged eternal life through the otherworldly entity, the Voidborn's only intention was satiating its eternal hunger. And so, when the Domineum had achieved a vastness fitting the Voidborn's craving, interdimensional rifts opened at the heart of the Domineum to unleash cosmic corruption. As the House of Novarchon and its followers welcomed the Voidborn and sought their false salvation, the entity infected and spread and seized control over the inner worlds. Now, it is time for the remaining Great Houses to purge the galactic corruption, prevent the Voidborn from fully manifesting in our dimension, and to ultimately overcome the chaos as the new rulers of the Domineum.\n\nVoidfall is a space 4X game that brings the genre to Euro enthusiasts' tables. It combines the tension, player interaction, and deep empire customization of the 4X genre with the resource management, tight decisions, and minimum-luck gameplay of an economic Euro. Win by pushing back the Voidborn in the solo/coop mode, or by overcoming your rivals' influence in restoring the Domineum in the competitive mode \u2014 both using the same rule set and game system. Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.\n\nAs the leader of a defiant Great House, you play through three cycles, each with a game-altering galactic event, a new scoring condition, and a set number of focus cards that can be played. Focus card decisions and sequencing is the centerpiece of the gameplay. By selecting two of their three impactful actions as you play them, you develop and improve techs; advance on your three house-specific civilization tracks; manage your sectors' infrastructure, population, and production; and conquer new sectors with up to five different types of space fleets. Space battles are fought either against the Voidborn's infected forces (which are present as neutral opponents even in the competitive mode) or against other players. Instead of relying on the luck of a die roll, battles in Voidfall are fully deterministic and reward careful preparation and outsmarting your opponents.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["Nigel Buckle:5864", "D\u00e1vid Turczi:76227"], "artist": ["Ian O'Toole:64844"], "publisher": ["Mindclash Games:29156", "Albi:4304", "CrowD Games:34522", "Engames:39390", "Ghenos Games:4785", "Grok Games:42325", "Maldito Games:30677", "Portal Games:2726", "Quality Beast:36831", "Rozum:53490", "Skellig Games:40058", "Super Meeple:29409", "YOKA Games:8147"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/337627", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__original/img/gIhusTrYRr_2JQGEv0zuSgLtuUo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6153324.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__small/img/Ov6eWR87PZ2O1XYQtXMO6KvfzOg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6153324.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6yq786vo6o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2FbBRqdPFw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YapuW8erXCI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjp5hkMu9r0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziKPUh7_tgw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP7ue20tJ-8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0fgcvmV7Yw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RhOYM6LLZI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9Z8UyiQyg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XerRytN4Oqc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sywGBqZ1uI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHyOd71tde4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1RSL5XSbTA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxORb7Q3BOE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9c44j7zFYQ"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 1, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 15, "min_age_rec": 15.655172413793103, "min_time": 90, "max_time": 240, "category": ["Civilization:1015", "Economic:1021", "Science Fiction:1016", "Space Exploration:1113"], "mechanic": ["Command Cards:2841", "Cooperative Game:2023", "Events:2850", "Grid Movement:2676", "Hand Management:2040", "Hexagon Grid:2026", "Modular Board:2011", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Variable Player Powers:2015"], "cooperative": true, "family": ["Components: Game Trayz Inside:48877", "Components: Hexagonal Tiles:67874", "Components: Map (Interplanetary or Interstellar scale):64949", "Components: Miniatures:25158", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Digital Implementations: TableTop Simulator Mod (TTS):73596", "Mechanism: 4X:12210"], "expansion": ["Voidfall: Resurgence:455819", "Voidfall: Stellar Nursery Promo:380061"], "implementation": [33759], "rank": 91, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 49, "bayes_rating": 7.78455}], "num_votes": 6354, "avg_rating": 8.51906, "stddev_rating": 1.4823, "bayes_rating": 7.61912, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 4.6032, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 337627, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:32+0000"},

Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that's fit to view.\n\nAndroid: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.\n\nCorporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with \"ice\". These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.\n\nIn turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.\n\nThe first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.\n\nThe Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs.

Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.\n\nDuring a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker.

Western histories often call this period \"The Great Game\" because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.\n\nIn terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.\n\nTo survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a \"Dominance Check\", is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.\n\nAfter each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.", "designer": ["Cole Wehrle:35585"], "artist": ["Cole Wehrle:35585"], "publisher": ["Wehrlegig Games:39814", "2Tomatoes Games:30571", "CrowD Games:34522", "Fox in the Box:33710", "Galakta:4617", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "Giochix.it:7251", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Spielworxx:15108", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (TendaysGames):22609", "YOKA Games:8147"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/256960", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__original/img/7DlaMCmuoJzm9AzelmStYIDgutI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4503733.png", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__small/img/NyoufH5YBFCh1rKy4uy76bR4ITk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4503733.png"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVWcYPRF9Vk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTX_ZPKSoaE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826zgaeNFpQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCxUPgtNfQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDyL54GfV28", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6z4Gw80-ow", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6bSVqLUFBc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqb1uPzy4oI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFMI35I8Hw0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2V5srAfX64", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho-xvAAgpus", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBzQWQDWNr0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNfi5SeyheE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-WGMZd0TGM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqYFD1YkH4Y"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 5, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 13, "min_age_rec": 13.975, "min_time": 45, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Economic:1021", "Educational:1094", "Negotiation:1026", "Political:1001", "Post-Napoleonic:2710", "Spies / Secret Agents:1081"], "mechanic": ["Action Points:2001", "Area Majority / Influence:2080", "Area Movement:2046", "Auction: Dutch:2924", "Bribery:2913", "Hand Management:2040", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914", "Negotiation:2915", "Open Drafting:2041", "Score-and-Reset Game:2823", "Simulation:2070", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Tags:3100", "Take That:2686"], "family": ["Components: Wooden pieces & boards:68769", "Country: Afghanistan:10632", "Country: India:9961", "Country: United Kingdom:17056", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Rally the Troops:72674", "Game: Pax Pamir:56858", "History: Anglo-Afghan Wars:58172", "Mechanism: Artificial Player:71181", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Series: Pax:44079", "Theme: Colonial:21622"], "implementation": [155255, 198843], "rank": 51, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 41, "bayes_rating": 7.82644}], "num_votes": 17068, "avg_rating": 8.12902, "stddev_rating": 1.53992, "bayes_rating": 7.76658, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.8476, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 256960, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

The working class faces a dismantled welfare system, the capitalists are losing their hard-earned profits, the middle class is gradually fading and the state is sinking into a deep deficit. Amidst all this chaos, the only person who can provide guidance is... you. Will you take the side of the working class and fight for social reforms? Or will you stand with the corporations and the free market? Will you help the government try to keep it all together, or will you try to enforce your agenda no matter the cost to the country?\n\nHegemony is an asymmetric politico-economic card-driven board game for 2-4 players that puts you in the role of one of the socio-economic groups in a fictional state: The Working Class, the Middle Class, the Capitalist Class and the State itself.\n\nThe Working class controls the workers. The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist's companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.\n\nWhile players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important. Through careful planning, strategic actions and political maneuvering, you will do your best to increase the power of your class and carry out your agenda.

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\n\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic co-operative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek new power, or to spread their presence into new areas of the island.\n\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming towns and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them, for example, to drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\n\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last explorer, town and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if explorers or even towns and cities remain.

As in its predecessor, you must develop, build and establish your industries and network in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.\n\nEach round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):\n\n1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.\n2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.\n3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.\n4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.\n5) Loan - Take a \u00a330 loan and reduce your income.\n\nBrass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:\n\n6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card.

These phases let players draw cards, play cards, add goods to worlds, or consume goods for VP chips. Only the phases chosen will occur that round. Every player may act in a phase that occurs, but the players who chose that phase get a bonus.\n\nGame end is triggered either when a player has built a civilization of 12 cards or when the pool of VP chips is exhausted. Each player then totals the victory points in their tableau plus any VP chips earned during play.\n\nDetailed Overview\nRace for the Galaxy tells a story of galactic discovery and expansion through a single deck of cards. Every card in the deck represents either a world that you might settle or a development that you might implement. Cards placed into your tableau represent your current achievements -- worlds you have colonized, technology you now wield -- while cards in your hand represent the options currently available to you.\n\nTo play a card, discard the number of cards equal to its cost, representing other opportunities you must forgo to concentrate on your current course. Once in your tableau, a card provides special powers during the game and, at the end, its listed number of victory points. Many worlds, once placed, also produce goods that can be traded for more cards or consumed for VP chips.\n\nRace for the Galaxy is played in rounds. In each round, you and your opponents secretly select an action phase for the upcoming turn. You can choose to:\n\u2022 Place a world in your tableau with settle or a development with develop.\n\u2022 Produce goods on worlds with produce.\n\u2022 Consume goods for VPs with consume.\n\u2022 Add cards to your hand with explore or by trading a good.\n\nEach round, only those phases that are selected will occur -- but they'll occur for everyone. Selecting a phase both ensures that it occurs that round and gains the selecting player a bonus.\n\nRound follows round until someone builds their tableau to twelve cards, or until the last VP chip is claimed. The victor is the player with the most VPs.\n\n2018 UPDATE\nThe second edition of the game is improved for CVD (color blindness) and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.\n\nUPC 655132003018", "designer": ["Thomas Lehmann:150"], "artist": ["Martin Hoffmann:11968", "Claus Stephan:11902"], "publisher": ["Rio Grande Games:3", "ABACUSSPIELE:29", "Albi:4304", "Ediciones MasQueOca:24883", "Feelindigo:36981", "Gabinete L\u00fadico:8500", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "Gamesinitaly:9465", "Ghenos Games:4785", "Giochix.it:7251", "Hobby Japan:1391", "Hobby World:18852", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Matagot:5400", "Pegasus Spiele:39", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "Smart Ltd:8313", "Wargames Club Publishing:8759", "YOKA Games:8147", "Ystari Games:2861"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__original/img/Vh-DCkTPa8OU45LaJdUywwhiYqE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5261714.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__small/img/xLs-ldTPwaADbvzkOpF0sgWzwck=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5261714.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vvBbO7-Dyk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQpGNJ65_K4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njd7R4_PWMA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrw1dBlXiWk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUU3bbuytak", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWoLtNuAn48", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_n2yJmtrf4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viyntvJHkzw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw_KngIKfEY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVMKNbIpkg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG0iVqrLl5U", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=600ROth6K_E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysw3ZjKaMJI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbZJsLujuQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS5Ulkj6tGw"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 2, "max_players_best": 2, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 12.018018018018019, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 60, "category": ["Card Game:1002", "Civilization:1015", "Economic:1021", "Science Fiction:1016", "Space Exploration:1113"], "mechanic": ["End Game Bonuses:2875", "Follow:2843", "Hand Management:2040", "Income:2902", "Market:2900", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Simultaneous Action Selection:2020", "Tags:3100", "Variable Phase Order:2079"], "family": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards:65191", "Digital Implementations: Apple App Store:104952", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Google Play:78432", "Digital Implementations: Steam:77349", "Game: Race for the Galaxy:4571", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: BGG Hall of Fame:109134", "Misc: Dice Tower Hall of Fame:105030", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play:65851", "Players: Games with expansions that change player count:113768"], "expansion": ["Patronage (fan expansion for Race for the Galaxy):145148", "Race for the Galaxy: Alien Artifacts:92932", "Race for the Galaxy: Expansion and Brinkmanship:270439", "Race for the Galaxy: New Worlds Promo Cards:242309", "Race for the Galaxy: Rebel vs Imperium:40210", "Race for the Galaxy: The Brink of War:66121", "Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm:34499", "Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Counterstrike:394555", "Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Invasion:161599"], "rank": 92, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 81, "bayes_rating": 7.62008}], "num_votes": 58414, "avg_rating": 7.7379, "stddev_rating": 1.46483, "bayes_rating": 7.61842, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 2.9917, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 2.2459893048128343, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 28143, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:32+0000"},

Recent years have seen your family farm prosper by diversifying your breeds of sheep and increasing the value of your wool.\n\nWith the dawn of the new century, difficult challenges have arisen. You must acquire improved and valuable breeds of sheep to ensure the prosperity of your family business and the labourers who work for you. Decide whether to focus on your past strengths or to diversify into new ventures. Will the beginning of the 20th century be as rewarding as earlier years, or will the efforts of others surpass your strategy? Good luck, and kia kaha!\n\nIn Great Western Trail New Zealand, you move your runholder along a trail that winds and forks from the lower left corner of the game board to Wellington in the upper right. Along your path, you perform actions that provide you with various ways to earn victory points.\n\nEach time your runholder reaches Wellington, you deliver sheep to a local or foreign trading post, which may also be worth victory points. Afterwards, your runholder continues its movement again.", "designer": ["Alexander Pfister:11767"], "artist": ["Chris Quilliams:14057"], "publisher": ["eggertspiele:1015", "Arclight Games:3475", "Delta Vision Publishing:6194", "Ediciones MasQueOca:24883", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "Ghenos Games:4785", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "Yayoi The Dreamer:42760", "Zvezda:1466"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/380607", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X4KaD6ADLW1ohOznNay7xg__original/img/HhxsLMIsz6Te567qXEbRBen4Sm8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7350809.png", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X4KaD6ADLW1ohOznNay7xg__small/img/iCWpe4ydO3Rtu6yBjn01eQ97xLc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7350809.png"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=809NiohFELk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri0XBllcoag", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lBtTHnlIZ0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eZ8jMYFo0I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWwqIUy0v10", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJwaArwfRzE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gld4iTXrc9E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEZ-UzkZh64", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhIrh69Y4VU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nufnKzghkYM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piQ6y3oZWXA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONfAZ03SeAs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAmXF9NFzuo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ7ggcgeExE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC2-tq9CN5I"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 12.363636363636363, "min_time": 75, "max_time": 150, "category": ["Animals:1089"], "mechanic": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664", "Hand Management:2040", "Ownership:2911", "Set Collection:2004", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Track Movement:2939", "Variable Set-up:2897"], "family": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!:22783", "Animals: Sheep:7481", "Country: New Zealand:10308", "Game: Great Western Trail:54030", "Occupation: Farmer:69363", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Theme: Colonial:21622"], "implementation": [341169], "rank": 82, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 39, "bayes_rating": 7.83221}], "num_votes": 6415, "avg_rating": 8.47799, "stddev_rating": 1.22453, "bayes_rating": 7.65267, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 4.0065, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 380607, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire\u2019s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.\n\nIn the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire\u2019s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.\n\nImperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You\u2019ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you\u2019ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.\n\nAs an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.\n\nWith these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.", "designer": ["Justin Kemppainen:72460", "Corey Konieczka:6651", "Jonathan Ying:78796"], "artist": ["Arden Beckwith:78030",

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.\n\nThe objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.\n\nHowever, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nAdditionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\n\u261b Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

Ragnar\u00f6k has come and it\u2019s the end of the world! It\u2019s the Vikings\u2019 last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their places in Valhalla at Odin\u2019s side! As a Viking you can pursue one of many pathways to glory. You can: invade and pillage the land for its rewards; crush your opponents in battle: fulfill quests: increase your clan's stats: or even die gloriously in battle or from Ragnar\u00f6k, the ultimate inescapable doom.\n\nMost player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \u201cGods\u2019 Gifts\u201d grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having many of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle. Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises. Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles or punishes the winner.\n\nPlayers must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents\u2019 strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent\u2019s actions and allegiances to specific gods you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!", "designer": ["Eric M.

To earn the most points and win the game, incorporate the habitats in your landscapes wisely and have as many animals as you can settle there.\n\nStarting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player will choose a set of 3 terrain tokens from the central area to place on their personal board. They may optionally choose an Animal card from the 5 displayed and/or place an Animal cube from their Animal card(s) on any completed patterns on their board that match their personal Animal cards. There is a 4-card limit per player. After their turn, refill with a new set of 3 tokens and a new Animal card if needed.\n\nPlacement of the terrain tokens will depend on the personal Animal card goals, and scoring rules for the various terrain types (mountain, field, forest, etc). For example, mountain tiles score based on how high they are (1 tile scores 1, while 3 tiles stacked score 7), but the mountain scores zero if it is not adjacent to at least one other mountain. If all the cubes on a given Animal card have been placed, the card is set aside and a new card can be drawn. The cards are scored at game end based on the highest number that isn't covered by a cube.\n\nThe games ends when there are no tokens left in the bag to refill the central area, or at least one players has 2 or fewer empty spaces on their player board. Play continues until all players have had an equal turn that round. The player with the highest points is the winner.\n\nOptionally, you can use Nature's Spirit cards for richer gameplay. During setup, each player chooses 1 of 2 spirit cards and places a Spirit cube on the card. They follow the same placement rules as Animal cards, but tend to have an ongoing effect once completed. The spirit card does count towards the 4-card hand limit.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["Johan Benvenuto:95323"], "artist": ["Ma\u00ebva da Silva:40295"], "publisher": ["Libellud:9051", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043", "CoolPlay:50696", "CrowD Games:34522", "Fj\u00f3rir \u00c1sar:55730", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "Hobby Japan:1391", "Kaissa Chess & Games:6214", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433:44209"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/414317", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A_XP2_VN3ugyqPhezowB_w__original/img/_Rv8lSr3fC1oDRkrQleQW2H2yCs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8026369.png", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A_XP2_VN3ugyqPhezowB_w__small/img/ln5eKAzhse2PIHvWn7bu-jiW_uk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8026369.png"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGcyAS5EYw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xaUJ_4VsRA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIj37cdD1pU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hlEsVHLlR8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2-G2BihIXo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_T3BDnCRuo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gm9ALfyMvA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr0aSGYTkPI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6VyfGffyFI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbDtpX9XDqs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFD6ewj9T94", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqaDg8QjDrw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MIoMcn08E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpMk8HeOhpc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvXYyEZPaLo"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 2, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 10, "min_age_rec": 8.242424242424242, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 45, "category": ["Abstract Strategy:1009", "Animals:1089", "Environmental:1084"], "mechanic": ["Chaining:2956", "Hexagon Grid:2026", "Open Drafting:2041", "Pattern Building:2048", "Set Collection:2004", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Tile Placement:2002", "Variable Player Powers:2015"], "family": ["Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: TableTop Simulator Mod (TTS):73596", "Misc: LongPack Games:59705", "Theme: Nature:48871"], "expansion": ["Harmonies: 4 Nature's Spirit pawns and 1 exclusive Nature's Spirit card:419336", "Harmonies: Extra Maps:458226"], "rank": 63, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "abstracts", "game_type_id": 4666, "name": "Abstract Game", "rank": 2, "bayes_rating": 7.64918}, {"game_type": "familygames", "game_type_id": 5499, "name": "Family Game", "rank": 10, "bayes_rating": 7.76698}], "num_votes": 25289, "avg_rating": 8.02948, "stddev_rating": 1.17755, "bayes_rating": 7.72889, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 2.0111, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 1.0, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 414317, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

You start the game insane, and while your long-term goal is to shoot Cthulhu in the face, so to speak, at some point during the game you'll probably fail to mitigate your dice rolls properly and your insanity will cause you to do something terrible \u2014 or maybe advantageous. Hard to know for sure.\n\nThe game has multiple episodes, and each of them has a similar structure of two acts, those being before and after you summon whatever it is you happen to be summoning. If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win.\n\nThe episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.", "designer": ["Rob Daviau:442", "Eric M.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.\n\nEach player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.\n\nThe resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.\n\nDuring each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \"Trader\" or \"Builder\"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \"Builder\" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.\n\nPuerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.\n\nPlayers earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.\n\nIn 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I \u2013 New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II \u2013 The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.", "designer": ["Andreas Seyfarth:117"], "artist": ["Franz Vohwinkel:11883"], "publisher": ["alea:9", "Ravensburger:34", "Albi:4304", "Devir:2366", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions:5657", "Kaissa Chess & Games:6214", "Lautapelit.fi:3218", "MINDOK:7992", "Rio Grande Games:3", "Stratelibri:3888", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234", "Tilsit:42", "VAKKO:46567"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__original/img/DOgIp57F7tKZvxeITGAd3e_Q9as=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic158548.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__small/img/5fLo89ChZH6Wzukk36bhZ-EpBS0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic158548.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yud9q5x2dEE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2JpfSlrzL8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlKALvQ9gus", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQh97b4nVbM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjSBR6n91t8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b88IlivFoWw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5Y-N47DMd8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34dPPfcZqRc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKQTwXip-7M", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uFkQ5GAJc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8dfH9e4IS8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90OriF0OrN0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG0X1uugJHE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQzTqQqKbCE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB-PlmGXhF8"], "min_players": 3, "max_players": 5, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 12.006944444444445, "min_time": 90, "max_time": 150, "category": ["City Building:1029", "Economic:1021", "Farming:1013"], "mechanic": ["Action Drafting:2838", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Follow:2843", "Hidden Victory Points:2987", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914", "Turn Order: Progressive:2828", "Variable Phase Order:2079"], "family": ["Components: Wooden pieces & boards:68769", "Country: Puerto Rico:10656", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: BrettspielWelt:76458", "Game: Puerto Rico:9958", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: Dice Tower Hall of Fame:105030", "Series: Alea Big Box:58", "Theme: Colonial:21622", "Theme: Tropical:18319"], "expansion": ["Deutscher Spielepreis Classic Goodie Box:286086", "Haiti (fan expansion for Puerto Rico):69178", "Puerto Rico: Buccaneer:292912", "Puerto Rico: Expansion I \u2013 New Buildings:12382", "Puerto Rico: Expansion II \u2013 The Nobles:159761", "Puerto Rico: Expansions 1&2 \u2013 The New Buildings & The Nobles:270125", "Puerto Rico: Festival en Puerto Rico:291423", "Treasure Chest:40688"], "rank": 53, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 55, "bayes_rating": 7.74259}], "num_votes": 73706, "avg_rating": 7.8987, "stddev_rating": 1.39052, "bayes_rating": 7.75414, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.2674, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 2.7225274725274726, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 3076, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\n\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points.

As members of a deep-sea expedition, you and your fellow crew are on a quest to locate the lost continent of Mu\u2014but your success depends on precision, teamwork, and a shared sense of timing.\n\nEach mission presents a new puzzle made up of unique tasks: perhaps one player must win a specific card, while another must avoid it entirely. The trick? You\u2019ll have to complete these challenges through standard trick-taking rules\u2014like in traditional card games\u2014but with extremely limited communication. Each round becomes a tightrope walk of strategic cardplay and silent coordination.\n\nBuilding on the acclaimed system of The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine, this sequel introduces a more dynamic mission system with variable difficulty levels, a fresh deck of task cards, and improved scalability for different player counts. Whether you\u2019re playing as a duo or a full five-person team, every game unfolds as a tightly wound tactical dance through the depths.\n\nWith 32 increasingly challenging missions and countless combinations of tasks, The Crew: Mission Deep Sea offers a replayable and rewarding dive into the unknown\u2014perfect for those who love trick-taking games with a twist of cooperation and pressure.", "designer": ["Thomas Sing:45563"], "artist": ["Marco Armbruster:120549"], "publisher": ["KOSMOS:37", "999 Games:267", "Devir:2366", "Galakta:4617", "Giochi Uniti:5530", "GP Games:21640", "IELLO:8923", "Kaissa Chess & Games:6214", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "MINDOK:7992", "MIPL:51614", "Piatnik:22", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234", "Thames & Kosmos:60627", "Zvezda:1466"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/324856", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuBqZ1sMaDAVVHF_OEJP4g__original/img/jGWxczXC_VWZofeAmlO_DkB0hCI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5988903.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuBqZ1sMaDAVVHF_OEJP4g__small/img/EdacXlcFZ06YK0-ZKa0oKwL4VCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5988903.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D1FcvgQPn8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAO79F_9n70", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6dSwLjxArU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZB1JgO3Hhc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik2CxcAUGoo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVYzv-y934", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj4o3v54F8s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8CFWtFXKxI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9sNalkk-Wk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNP8-cC7HNo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chJoVHhh-7I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUQLMTQxrkI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOv5iWtg_V8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To6VPM2y98E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT9OGMjymaI"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "min_players_rec": 3, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 10, "min_age_rec": 10.067567567567568, "min_time": 20, "max_time": 20, "category": ["Adventure:1022", "Card Game:1002", "Mythology:1082", "Nautical:1008"], "mechanic": ["Communication Limits:2893", "Cooperative Game:2023", "Deduction:3002", "Hand Management:2040", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822", "Trick-taking:2009"], "cooperative": true, "family": ["Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Game: The Crew:63179", "Mechanism: Artificial Player:71181", "Misc: LongPack Games:59705", "Theme: Under the Sea:66105"], "expansion": ["The Crew: Mission Deep Sea \u2013 Captain for the Day:350373"], "implementation": [284083], "rank": 43, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 36, "bayes_rating": 7.84558}, {"game_type": "familygames", "game_type_id": 5499, "name": "Family Game", "rank": 4, "bayes_rating": 7.8721}], "num_votes": 24338, "avg_rating": 8.06288, "stddev_rating": 1.3159, "bayes_rating": 7.81248, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 2.048, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 2.7083333333333335, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 324856, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!\n\nIn the game, you, alone or with a friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets), become investigators within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.\n\nNo matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.\n\nEach of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...\n\nThe basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand\u2014and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better

You must develop, build and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize on demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each phase. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:\n\n\nBuild an industry tile\nBuild a rail or canal\nDevelop an industry\nSell cotton\nTake a loan\n\n\nAt the end of your turn, you replace the two cards you played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, the lowest spender going first. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.\n\nAfter all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed from the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and double-connection builds (though expensive) are possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.\n\nThe cards limit where you can build your industries, sell cotton or build connections (though any card can be used to 'develop'). This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if you build a rail line (which requires coal) you have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).\n\nBrass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:\n\n\nThe virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.\nThe three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.\nTwo-player rules have been created and are playable without the need of an alternate board.\nThe level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.", "designer": ["Martin Wallace:6"], "artist": ["Gavan Brown:32887", "Lina Cossette:70571", "Peter Dennis:11802", "David Forest:70568", "Eckhard Freytag:12011", "Damien Mammoliti:38179"], "publisher": ["Roxley:21765", "Warfrog Games:7", "Arclight Games:3475", "BoardM Factory:25074", "Conclave Editora:11043", "CrowD Games:34522", "Dexker Games:31071", "Eagle-Gryphon Games:597", "FRED Distribution, Inc.:7097", "Funforge:8832", "Ghenos Games:4785", "Giant Roc:42147", "Maldito Games:30677", "Pegasus Spiele:39", "PHALANX:36186", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "Wargames Club Publishing:8759", "White Goblin Games:4932"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28720", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tHVtPzu82mBpeQbbZkV6EA__original/img/3ffdJj5Pz6HQrg09Kh8ecTen-TY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3469216.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tHVtPzu82mBpeQbbZkV6EA__small/img/AghH1bAEhqzvyRcP3cy5G-rz0So=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3469216.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHG2yePmVDU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgjyI6FzRAQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PgiZ-BVFKc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCKSP0qmu-o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RsxMTfJOp0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGOgJrDe9uc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqL-SyF2ci8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3hzKLGaXSw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WN81OfxlGE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpcaF_4QfHw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WdtUA_Q88U", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gv9dUStgzs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfWM-WX2F_Q", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61bFE9HbjgY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWTYACbActg"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 13.824561403508772, "min_time": 60, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Economic:1021", "Educational:1094", "Industry / Manufacturing:1088", "Post-Napoleonic:2710", "Transportation:1011"], "mechanic": ["Chaining:2956", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Hand Management:2040", "Income:2902", "Loans:2904", "Market:2900", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Network and Route Building:2081", "Ownership:2911", "Tags:3100", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849", "Tile Placement:2002", "Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826", "Variable Set-up:2897"], "family": ["Cities: Manchester (England, UK):18587", "Components: Map (Regional scale):81601", "Country: England:14759", "Crowdfunding: Spieleschmiede:22135", "Digital Implementations: Apple App Store:104952", "Digital Implementations: Steam:77349", "Game: Brass:57499", "History: Industrial Revolution:50152", "Misc: BGG Hall of Fame:109134", "Misc: LongPack Games:59705", "Theme: Canals:66445"], "expansion": ["Brass: 2-player board:201381", "Catalonia (fan expansion for Brass):138329"], "rank": 22, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 19, "bayes_rating": 8.00793}], "num_votes": 26931, "avg_rating": 8.197, "stddev_rating": 1.36125, "bayes_rating": 7.95877, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.8481, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 1.0531914893617023, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 28720, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.\n\nPlayers do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.\n\nPlayers can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.\n\nYou can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.", "designer": ["Antoine Bauza:9714", "Bruno Cathala:1727"], "artist": ["Miguel Coimbra:12016"], "publisher": ["Repos Production:4384", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043", "asmodee:157", "Asterion Press:15889", "Boardgame Space:34501", "CoolPlay:50696", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "Hobby Japan:1391", "KADABRA:9634", "Kaissa Chess & Games:6214", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lautapelit.fi:3218", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd:9325", "Ludicus Games:30399", "Ponva d.o.o.:31904", "Pridemage Games:36366", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "Siam Board Games:33998", "Sombreros Production:32645", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433:44209"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173346", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zdagMskTF7wJBPjX74XsRw__original/img/Ju836WNSaW7Mab9Vjq2TJ_FqhWQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2576399.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zdagMskTF7wJBPjX74XsRw__small/img/gV1-ckZSIC-dCxxpq1Y7GmPITzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2576399.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpRPhj0xbX8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVEw02_wQlU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DTntx_BYS8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS5swy2VYsw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqVy1DVsVGo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK6uNf4fq00", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5023xjtVtRs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdHGk_DzUUg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_R9ZdHLqnU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEOoRVcBT58", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54_3FVsZI78", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iySmK-MtKo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFoYaBtuY4s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9G8OAo9LvM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoCjJ2R3vNc"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 2, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 2, "min_players_best": 2, "max_players_best": 2, "min_age": 10, "min_age_rec": 9.92896174863388, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 30, "category": ["Ancient:1050", "Card Game:1002", "City Building:1029", "Civilization:1015", "Economic:1021"], "mechanic": ["End Game Bonuses:2875", "Income:2902", "Melding and Splaying:2981", "Modular Board:2011", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846", "Open Drafting:2041", "Score-and-Reset Game:2823", "Set Collection:2004", "Sudden Death Ending:2884", "Tags:3100", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849", "Track Movement:2939", "Tug of War:2888", "Variable Set-up:2897"], "family": ["Ancient: Babylon:27524", "Ancient: Egypt:72535", "Ancient: Greece:52373", "Ancient: Rome:5606", "Constructions: Pyramids:77012", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Google Play:78432", "Game: 7 Wonders:17552", "Game: 7 Wonders Duel:39540", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: Watch It Played How To Videos:78198", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play:65851", "Players: Two-Player Only Games:61979", "Versions & Editions: Two-Player Versions of More-Player Games:62276"], "expansion": ["7 Wonders Duel: Agora:309116", "7 Wonders Duel: Agora \u2013 Tu Quoque Fili Promo Card:348601", "7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon:202976", "7 Wonders Duel: Solo:310215", "7 Wonders Duel: Statue of Liberty Promo Card:196339", "7 Wonders Duel: The Messe Promo Card:186069", "Leaders (fan expansion for 7 Wonders Duel):274383"], "implementation": [68448], "rank": 23, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 27, "bayes_rating": 7.91988}], "num_votes": 106762, "avg_rating": 8.08039, "stddev_rating": 1.19983, "bayes_rating": 7.95502, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 2.2272, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 1.0387931034482758, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 173346, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

At the beginning, the game starts in a very similar fashion as basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hot spots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nDuring a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.\n\nAfter a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.\n\nEach month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.\n\nDuring the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.\n\nPart of the Pandemic series", "designer": ["Rob Daviau:442", "Matt Leacock:378"], "artist": ["Chris Quilliams:14057"], "publisher": ["Z-Man Games:538", "Asterion Press:15889", "Devir:2366", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions:5657", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "Hobby Japan:1391", "Jolly Thinkers:15983", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lacerta:5812", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd:9325", "MINDOK:7992", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433:44209"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__original/img/PlzAH7swN1nsFxOXbfUvE3TkE5w=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2452831.png", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__small/img/NQQcjS31TO0DE246N9rpt0hd9eo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2452831.png"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLQdovclO0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mqXKVqvs0c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbhy1OVzwwg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3Pmftj33no", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8McyhsiUM8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g11eKhJ8GUo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTXqT7lrn6o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIAmH7tNRe8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k_B_rb0y6c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmRuAI7ByOs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83mBFVLyIt0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5R6sUiQKN8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axDfYYS0UGw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bTO139PkTQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnl6PUnoIm8"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 13, "min_age_rec": 11.734567901234568, "min_time": 60, "max_time": 60, "category": ["Environmental:1084", "Medical:2145"], "mechanic": ["Action Points:2001", "Cooperative Game:2023", "Hand Management:2040", "Legacy Game:2824", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Point to Point Movement:2078", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822", "Set Collection:2004", "Tags:3100", "Trading:2008", "Variable Player Powers:2015"], "cooperative": true, "family": ["Components: Map (Global Scale):64952", "Components: Multi-Use Cards:65191", "Game: Pandemic:3430", "Mechanism: Campaign Games:24281", "Mechanism: Legacy:25404", "Medical: Diseases:61854", "Misc: Limited Replayability:72224", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Occupation: Dispatcher:63526", "Occupation: Medic / Doctor / Nurses:63524", "Occupation: Researcher / Scientist:63525", "Region: The World:62881", "Theme: Science:66167", "Versions & Editions: Legacy Versions of Non-Legacy Games:62899"], "implementation": [30549], "rank": 3, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "thematic", "game_type_id": 5496, "name": "Thematic", "rank": 1, "bayes_rating": 8.35809}, {"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 3, "bayes_rating": 8.34004}], "num_votes": 56869, "avg_rating": 8.50611, "stddev_rating": 1.60816, "bayes_rating": 8.35107, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 2.8277, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 4.084615384615384, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 161936, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.\n\nIn the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board.

During a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight, there echoes a bone-chilling scream. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the town storyteller murdered, their body impaled on the hands of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in time to execute the true demon and save themselves? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful village?\n\nBlood on the Clocktower is a bluffing game with players on opposing teams of Good and Evil, overseen by a Storyteller player who conducts the action and makes crucial decisions. The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.\n\nDuring a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. During a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.\n\nThe Storyteller uses the game's intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave. If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it's started as a powerful Traveller character with unusual talents and questionable allegiances. Each character comes with their own special ability and no two players in a game are ever the same character.", "designer": ["Steven Medway:105325"], "artist": ["Micaela Dawn:120101", "Aidan Roberts:151198", "John VanFleet:14773", "Grace VanFleet:151197"], "publisher": ["The Pandemonium Institute:39568", "A-Z kiad\u00f3:56756", "Bumble3ee Interactive:48072", "Fox in the Box:33710", "Funtails:40576", "Old Dawg:55187", "Open Sesame Games:44780"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/240980", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__original/img/e7izEwSmnBPiErsIF6hlWbgybBE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7009391.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__small/img/cRCX-PIROiSFG5aLvwkn2O7tHsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7009391.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j28lP0eraKw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzV1L2bdMqE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWaQuo2j5js", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYwjPJDLdxM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdPDOGtAppA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tjIxRNuHf8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTTMaWKyX6A", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SL6MBFnf-0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRVsIhkv1WI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAozxtixzA0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha4pwcLUOOg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eef5JOeq7l0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2j3g6pBNCk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XVrDcQ_m1w", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Orzo7XElB2U"], "min_players": 6, "max_players": 21, "min_players_rec": 7, "max_players_rec": 16, "min_players_best": 9, "max_players_best": 12, "min_age": 15, "min_age_rec": 13.5, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Bluffing:1023", "Deduction:1039", "Murder / Mystery:1040", "Party Game:1030"], "mechanic": ["Betting and Bluffing:2014", "Deduction:3002", "Hidden Roles:2891", "Negotiation:2915", "Player Elimination:2685", "Prisoner's Dilemma:2858", "Rock-Paper-Scissors:2003", "Roles with Asymmetric Information:2892", "Team-Based Game:2019", "Traitor Game:2814", "Variable Player Powers:2015", "Voting:2017"], "family": ["Components: Game Box Used In Play:68117", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Game: Werewolf / Mafia:2989"], "expansion": ["Blood on the Clocktower: Clocktower Con 2023 Experimental Characters:385755", "Blood on the Clocktower: The Cacklejack \u2013 Experimental Character:459848", "Blood on the Clocktower: The Carousel \u2013 Experimental Character Collection:449904"], "rank": 74, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 56, "bayes_rating": 7.73695}, {"game_type": "partygames", "game_type_id": 5498, "name": "Party Game", "rank": 1, "bayes_rating": 7.85962}], "num_votes": 10317, "avg_rating": 8.35976, "stddev_rating": 1.9081, "bayes_rating": 7.68185, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.0326, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 240980, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

At first, on a turn, your family gets to take only two actions, one for you and one for your spouse, as might be found among all the possibilities on a farm: plowing fields; collecting materials; building fences, and so on. There are numerous choices available, and while the game progresses you'll have more and more, as each round a new action card is flipped over, offering one more possible action. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished but first you'll need to expand your house to make room - and what are you going to feed all the little rug rats?\n\nThe game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the distribution of cards which represent Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release) these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist. Each player starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit into his/her strategy.\n\nAgricola is a turn-based game, and the problem to be overcome is that each available action can be taken by only one player each round so it's important to be careful about your choices. There are countless strategies, some of which depend on your hand of cards.\n\nThe winner is the player with the most Victory Points from the Improvements made on his farm.\n\n-description originally from BoardgameNews", "designer": ["Uwe Rosenberg:10"], "artist": ["Klemens Franz:11507"], "publisher": ["Lookout Games:234", "999 Games:267", "Brain Games:7162", "Compaya.hu: Gamer Caf\u00e9 Kft.:14813", "Devir:2366", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions:5657", "Funforge:8832", "Hobby Japan:1391", "Hobby World:18852", "HomoLudicus:6275", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lacerta:5812", "MINDOK:7992", "Smart Ltd:8313", "Stratelibri:3888", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234", "Ystari Games:2861", "Z-Man Games:538"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__original/img/toobKoejPiHpfpHk4SYd1UAJafw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic831744.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__small/img/GHGdnCfeysoP_34gLnofJcNivW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic831744.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhBx1m4kg38", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCQRGNj4cnA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRr9pmxEL7Q", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Grj8nnc4o4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOTMKrlenfE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naaHMUwIT1g", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH-oA5BBc-0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6nowB0WZGc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf5zYNpIzws", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGDpkIhUQjQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ojqjk5k9sA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k4P_kVFw_c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veq6hNpEsO8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZksHAGWYEM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OseNfXlB7iU"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 5, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 11.873362445414847, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 150, "category": ["Animals:1089", "Economic:1021", "Farming:1013"], "mechanic": ["Automatic Resource Growth:2903", "Closed Drafting:2984", "Enclosure:2043", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Turn Order: Claim Action:2829", "Worker Placement:2082"], "family": ["Animals: Cattle / Cows:7530", "Animals: Horses:7523", "Animals: Pigs:7379", "Animals: Sheep:7481", "Components: Meeples (Animal) / Animeeples:64990", "Components: Wooden pieces & boards:68769", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Boiteajeux:70361", "Game: Agricola:3865", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: BGG Hall of Fame:109134", "Misc: Dice Tower Hall of Fame:105030", "Occupation: Farmer:69363", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg):3866", "Theme: Food / Cooking:5841"], "expansion": ["Agricola Ereigniskarten:113413", "Agricola: Agricola Meets Newdale:292850", "Agricola: Animal trainer:242392", "Agricola: Belgium Deck:131403", "Agricola: Bielefeld Deck:150732", "Agricola: Brakelh\u00fchner Promo Card:132592", "Agricola: Changelings:263965", "Agricola: Clay deposit:242391", "Agricola: CZ-Deck:59158", "Agricola: De Lage Landen:109012", "Agricola: Farmers of the Moor:43018", "Agricola: Feed pellets:242390", "Agricola: France Deck:166463", "Agricola: Gamers' Deck:85704", "Agricola: Glon\u00adna\u00adcker:183316", "Agricola: Guildmaster:242388", "Agricola: L-Deck:39090", "Agricola: NL-Deck:103182", "Agricola: \u00d6-Deck:39256", "Agricola: Pelts:242389", "Agricola: Pi-Deck:130847", "Agricola: Rancher:242350", "Agricola: Roz\u0161\u00ed\u0159en\u00ed:240737", "Agricola: The Goodies Expansion:73833", "Agricola: The Legen*dairy Forest-Deck:83697", "Agricola: Through the Seasons:38641", "Agricola: Times they are a-changing:279703", "Agricola: World Championship Deck \u2013 2011:103183", "Agricola: X-Deck:38733", "Agricola: Z-Deck:37235", "Improved Farming & Disasters (fan expansion for Agricola):114557", "The MY Deck (fan expansion for Agricola):73500"], "rank": 64, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 62, "bayes_rating": 7.71508}], "num_votes": 76142, "avg_rating": 7.8595, "stddev_rating": 1.54655, "bayes_rating": 7.72781, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.6353, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 4.02514506769826, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 31260, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

Proximity to other factions may limit your expansion, but it also gains you significant advantages in the game. This tension adds to the appeal of the Terra Mystica series.\n\nUpgrade your buildings to gain valuable resources such as tools, scholars, money, and power.

They have a few plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n\nThe players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n\nFortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful. Using those workers and visitors, the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders, working towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.\n\nViticulture Essential Edition includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from the original Tuscany expansion, including Mamas & Papas, Fields (previously known as Properties), expanded and revised Visitors, and Automa cards for a solo variant, along with a few minor rule changes.", "designer": ["Jamey Stegmaier:62640", "Alan Stone:62641"], "artist": ["Jacqui Davis:65633", "David Montgomery:44234", "Beth Sobel:71164"], "publisher": ["Stonemaier Games:23202", "Albi:4304", "Angry Lion Games:38809", "Arclight Games:3475", "Board Game Rookie:44580", "Delta Vision Publishing:6194", "Feuerland Spiele:22380", "Ghenos Games:4785", "Kilogames:32866", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lavka Games:34801", "Ludofy Creative:29242", "Maldito Games:30677", "Matagot:5400", "PHALANX:36186", "Regatul Jocurilor:44241", "Surfin' Meeple China:36763", "Tower Tactic Games:39774"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183394", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l_PRU2lVlX9seScRFcvFlA__original/img/gDL7OZFlzoOFgU0VYlREs8P5hCQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6500949.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l_PRU2lVlX9seScRFcvFlA__small/img/pULDtVd75QZgGfvSMhr6Rs07vK8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6500949.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMOrK9TBGxA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RERVEn07R9I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6tnYqEfkhU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyEpHZAwrNw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGCD-euAewQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNKjiDp4dAg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7YRohvaJHM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDj9nnNHa8A", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAlp5ZDb5uI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6J_AjDWsn8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaLGt6fNsrg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBYChj_Osgo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj6kp10g3Oo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8F01DasJhc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2THWOlrZhaA"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 6, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 13, "min_age_rec": 11.8875, "min_time": 45, "max_time": 90, "category": ["Economic:1021", "Farming:1013"], "mechanic": ["Contracts:2912", "Hand Management:2040", "Race:2876", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Turn Order: Auction:2827", "Victory Points as a Resource:2874", "Worker Placement:2082", "Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"], "compilation": true, "compilation_of": [140045], "family": ["Components: Control Boards:66553", "Components: Meeples (Animal) / Animeeples:64990", "Components: Wooden pieces & boards:68769", "Country: Italy:11515", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: BoardSpace:80224", "Digital Implementations: Steam:77349", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Food & Drink: Wine:8496", "Game: Viticulture:23988", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Organizations: Automa Factory:72487", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Series: Uwe Rosenberg Collection (Feuerland Spiele):73689"], "expansion": ["Tuscany & Euphoria Crossover Structures:256549", "Viticulture World: Cooperative Expansion:360226", "Viticulture World: First Game Continent Promo Pack:364100", "Viticulture: Arboriculture and Formaggio Expansions:130655", "Viticulture: Bordeaux Expansion:462369", "Viticulture: Moor Visitors Expansion:193823", "Viticulture: Tuscany \u2013 Special Worker Promo Cards:214463", "Viticulture: Tuscany Essential Edition:202174", "Viticulture: Visit from the Rhine Valley:248929"], "implementation": [128621], "rank": 44, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 46, "bayes_rating": 7.80314}], "num_votes": 54164, "avg_rating": 7.96253, "stddev_rating": 1.27681, "bayes_rating": 7.81084, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 2.8951, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 3.125, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 183394, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.\n\nThe nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as \u201cThe Factory\u201d, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.\n\nScythe is an engine-building game set in a 1920s era, alternate-history. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player controls one of five factions of Eastern Europe, all of which are attempting to earn their fortunes and claim their stakes in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.\n\nEach player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction\u2019s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.\n\nScythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player\u2019s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \u201cencounter\u201d cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engines adds to the unique feel of each game, even if having played one faction multiple times.", "designer": ["Jamey Stegmaier:62640"], "artist": ["Jakub Rozalski:33148"], "publisher": ["Stonemaier Games:23202", "Albi:4304", "Angry Lion Games:38809", "Arclight Games:3475", "CrowD Games:34522", "Delta Vision Publishing:6194", "Feuerland Spiele:22380", "Fire on Board Jogos:30213", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "Geekach LLC:58739", "Ghenos Games:4785", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Ludofy Creative:29242", "Maldito Games:30677", "Matagot:5400", "Morning:28323", "PHALANX:36186", "Planeta Igor:56068", "Playfun Games:34744", "Surfin' Meeple China:36763"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__original/img/HlDb9F365w0tSP8uD1vf1pfniQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3163924.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__small/img/eQ69OEDdjYjfKg6q5Navee87skU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3163924.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfOF1levfEw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvLhCd8IRLE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBaC1HNkiOg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkVMYufEnHc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uCR1AWhrX8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cOEX-bRTpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FTq64Uj_LQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYX8_EjVRZs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw1OGLdtmXY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6uYyqWJOOQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhQw3PW0bB8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GL_MN4mQBk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eciw7MPGT7U", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD3pmTnWXng", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qeJ5kCm00A"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 5, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 12.344827586206897, "min_time": 115, "max_time": 115, "category": ["Economic:1021", "Fighting:1046", "Science Fiction:1016", "Territory Building:1086"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence:2080", "Card Play Conflict Resolution:2857", "Contracts:2912", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Force Commitment:2864", "Grid Movement:2676", "Hexagon Grid:2026", "King of the Hill:2886", "Movement Points:2947", "Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Take That:2686", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849", "Variable Player Powers:2015", "Variable Set-up:2897", "Victory Points as a Resource:2874", "Zone of Control:2974"], "family": ["Category: Autonomous simulation:106514", "Category: Dized Tutorial:77906", "Components: Meeples:79006", "Components: Control Boards:66553", "Components: Map (Continental / National scale):64960", "Components: Miniatures:25158", "Components: Wooden pieces & boards:68769", "Continents: Europe:50153", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Decades: The 1920's:73776", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Google Play:78432", "Digital Implementations: Steam:77349", "Digital Implementations: TableTop Simulator Mod (TTS):73596", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Game: Scythe:38432", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Misc: Watch It Played How To Videos:78198", "Organizations: Automa Factory:72487", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Theme: Alternate History:26464", "Theme: Dieselpunk:37870", "Theme: Mech Warfare:63004"], "expansion": ["Scythe: Bonus Promo Pack \u2013 6 Promo Encounter Cards numbers 37-42:276229", "Scythe: Encounters:262151", "Scythe: Invaders from Afar:199727", "Scythe: Modular Board:279304", "Scythe: Promo Pack #1 \u2013 Encounter Cards 29-32:211731", "Scythe: Promo Pack #11 \u2013 Encounter Card 39:221033", "Scythe: Promo Pack #12 \u2013 Encounter Card 40:232176", "Scythe: Promo Pack #13 \u2013 Encounter Card 41:232087", "Scythe: Promo Pack #14 \u2013 Encounter Card 42:237663", "Scythe: Promo Pack #2 \u2013 Encounter Cards 33-36:205121", "Scythe: Promo Pack #3 \u2013 Objective Cards 24-27:211732", "Scythe: Promo Pack #4 \u2013 Factory Cards 13-18:211733", "Scythe: Promo Pack #6 \u2013 Encounter Card 37:212879", "Scythe: Promo Pack #7 \u2013 Encounter Card 38:204984", "Scythe: The Rise of Fenris:242277", "Scythe: The Wind Gambit:223555"], "rank": 24, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 25, "bayes_rating": 7.92334}], "num_votes": 91760, "avg_rating": 8.10603, "stddev_rating": 1.45728, "bayes_rating": 7.95232, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.4526, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 2.9038461538461537, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 169786, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

Kennedy\n\nIn 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors.\n\nTwilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new \"superpowers\" scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.\n\nTwilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources? Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.\n\nTIME SCALE: approx. 3-5 years per turn\nMAP SCALE: Point-to-point system\nUNIT SCALE: Influence markers", "designer": ["Ananda Gupta:3876", "Jason Matthews:3877"], "artist": ["Viktor Csete:50825", "Rodger B.

Players will take on the roles of wandering adventurers with their own special sets of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.\nThis is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions about what to do next, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d book. Playing through a scenario is a co-operative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.\n\nEach turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player\u2019s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end u exhausted and be forced to retreat.", "designer": ["Isaac Childres:69802"], "artist": ["Alexandr Elichev:77084", "Josh T.

The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!\n\nDesigned by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard \"worker placement\" genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place \u2013 and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.\n\nAs befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.", "designer": ["Bruno Cathala:1727"], "artist": ["Cl\u00e9ment Masson:78139"], "publisher": ["Days of Wonder:1027", "Arclight Games:3475", "Asterion Press:15889", "CrowD Games:34522", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lord of Boards:46500", "Maldito Games:30677", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157354", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__original/img/PS9HXrThM8Pepbd-cuA1tX8KCYU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2055255.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__small/img/I6KVJlQgS1GfWDPSWAFNqce4Cgc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2055255.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vw-5zZrNv4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdR-NRHyfKk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI1PtxUUVpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiduBJfMUok", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6_gLGGMi0M", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRBTCwDLGQ8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hsXFST7OOQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW5Lfmi4k7k", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z24R9ZGOh7A", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsmvIy0kjS8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45Bfr_xIyPE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVofax_ctNo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b2BszTA_ms", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-NBI5DvBls", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS-27VYYfPA"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 2, "max_players_best": 2, "min_age": 13, "min_age_rec": 11.828125, "min_time": 40, "max_time": 80, "category": ["Arabian:1052", "Fantasy:1010", "Mythology:1082"], "mechanic": ["Auction / Bidding:2012", "Constrained Bidding:2922", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Hidden Victory Points:2987", "Mancala:2955", "Modular Board:2011", "Set Collection:2004", "Square Grid:2940", "Take That:2686", "Turn Order: Auction:2827", "Variable Player Powers:2015", "Variable Set-up:2897", "Victory Points as a Resource:2874"], "family": ["Animals: Camels:6480", "Components: Meeples (Animal) / Animeeples:64990", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Game: Five Tribes:57506", "Mythology: Arabian:62885", "Players: Games with expansions that change player count:113768", "Region: Middle East:59608"], "expansion": ["Five Tribes: Dhenim:167309", "Five Tribes: Galbells:220551", "Five Tribes: The Artisans of Naqala:176677", "Five Tribes: The Thieves of Naqala:199310", "Five Tribes: Whims of the Sultan:226828", "Five Tribes: Wilwit:176234"], "rank": 95, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 85, "bayes_rating": 7.61178}], "num_votes": 44689, "avg_rating": 7.76468, "stddev_rating": 1.26711, "bayes_rating": 7.6095, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 2.8392, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 1.1923076923076923, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 157354, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:32+0000"},

At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.\n\nPlayers represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!\n\nThe game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:\n\n\nPlayers' turns\nProduction phase\nRound scoring\n\n\n1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions, from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting. When players run out of money, they pass and collect a passing bonus.\n\n2.

A ring of posts is set around the inner circle, which functions as an obstacle to reach this area. Playing pieces are wooden circular disks similar to checkers pieces. Players take turns shooting disks across the board by flicking them with their fingers in an effort to land them in the highest scoring ring on the board, the highest score (20 points) achieved by shooting a disk into the centre, recessed hole. From the outside in, rings are worth 5, 10, 15 points.\n\nAs a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.\n\nEach disk to be shot must be placed on the outer boundary and within the shooting player's quadrant. If there are no opponent's disks on the board, the shot disk must land in the inner ring or it is removed. If there is an opponent's disk on the board, the shot disk must hit an opponent's piece, either directly, or by bumping another disk into it. Disks landing in the centre hole are removed and scored at the end of the round. Disks that lie outside--or are touching--the outer boundary after each shot are removed from play for the round.\n\nThe player to score the most points wins the round and scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A \"game\" is usually played to four rounds. The number of \"games\" in a match is set by the tournament.\n\nAlternatively, play is to a set score, usually the first player or team to 100, and each round is scored by cancellation. For example if Player One scores 250, and Player Two scores 225, then Player One will add 25 to his/her game score.", "designer": ["(Uncredited):3"], "artist": ["Allison Litchfield:84274", "Orlando Ramirez:12965"], "publisher": ["(Public Domain):171", "(Unknown):3320", "alfaset:11748", "BrownCastle Games:47309", "Carrom Company:755", "Cogitate Games:25960", "Coleco Industries, Inc.:1139", "Crokinole World:7804", "Felsberger:5686", "Ferti:1562", "Gameland \u6e38\u620f\u5927\u9646:38209", "Gerhards Spiel und Design:2407", "Hilinski Brothers:18842", "Industries Prince, Inc.:9942", "John Jaques of London:5722", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Let's Play Games!

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.\n\nTaking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:\n\n\nDesert (Fakirs, Nomads)\nPlains (Halflings, Cultists)\nSwamp (Alchemists, Darklings)\nLake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)\nForest (Witches, Auren)\nMountain (Dwarves, Engineers)\nWasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)\n\n\nProximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficult...\n\nTerra Mystica FAQ", "designer": ["Jens Dr\u00f6gem\u00fcller:4300", "Helge Ostertag:4407"], "artist": ["Dennis Lohausen:12484"], "publisher": ["Feuerland Spiele:22380", "Bard Centrum Gier:9074", "Capstone Games:30958", "Cranio Creations:10768", "Devir:2366", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions:5657", "FunBox Jogos:24298", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "HomoLudicus:6275", "Mandala Jogos:35035", "MINDOK:7992", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (TendaysGames):22609", "White Goblin Games:4932", "Z-Man Games:538", "Zvezda:1466"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bre12I1YiXkZr7elvriz4A__original/img/_dZS7fVfdc4DhJPbqnDpwTT4uF0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5375624.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bre12I1YiXkZr7elvriz4A__small/img/GW-ip0dfeAee7KQqJ04SRZxF1lg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375624.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo9AAkEhc9g", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0JQl2j6uEU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFfp1K9evbA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozRwP7KzYto", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8O_2tLuQ5s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDxZ-7b1NOk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFKZ_Yr-Z4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3URfddiHSA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYr1yC-BW7U", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgQYxn_-t_c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQe-bFd4qCE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7gN70RN2rw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnsU0nsF_A", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u2DdK-KiNI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSsXZxU9jek"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 12.48076923076923, "min_time": 60, "max_time": 150, "category": ["Civilization:1015", "Economic:1021", "Fantasy:1010", "Territory Building:1086"], "mechanic": ["Chaining:2956", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Hexagon Grid:2026", "Income:2902", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914", "Network and Route Building:2081", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849", "Turn Order: Pass Order:2830", "Variable Player Powers:2015", "Variable Set-up:2897", "Victory Points as a Resource:2874"], "family": ["Category: Combinatorial:26432", "Components: Control Boards:66553", "Components: Map (Continental / National scale):64960", "Components: Wooden pieces & boards:68769", "Creatures: Dwarves & Gnomes:73583", "Creatures: Mermaids:113944", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Google Play:78432", "Digital Implementations: Steam:77349", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Digital Implementations: Yucata:70354", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: BGG Hall of Fame:109134", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play:65851", "Series: Terra Mystica:26098", "Theme: Witches:28880"], "expansion": ["Terra Mystica: 4 Town Tiles:149890", "Terra Mystica: Automa Solo Box:349169", "Terra Mystica: Fan Factions:356035", "Terra Mystica: Fire & Ice:161317", "Terra Mystica: Merchants of the Seas:280885", "Terra Mystica: Mini expansion:184895", "Terra Mystica: Shipping Value Promo Card:150740"], "rank": 35, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 34, "bayes_rating": 7.87381}], "num_votes": 50550, "avg_rating": 8.03509, "stddev_rating": 1.47288, "bayes_rating": 7.8634, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.973, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 1.0257142857142858, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 120677, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. During the game, you control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. The soldier, on the other hand...\n\nNemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game, you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, agendas held by your fellow players, and sometimes just cruel fate.\n\nThe gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.", "designer": ["Adam Kwapi\u0144ski:61569"], "artist": ["Piotr Foksowicz:39040", "Patryk J\u0119draszek:113980", "Ewa Labak:114786", "Andrzej P\u00f3\u0142toranos:113981"], "publisher": ["Awaken Realms:29412", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "Arclight Games:3475", "asmodee:157", "Cranio Creations:10768", "Delta Vision Publishing:6194", "Funforge:8832", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "Geekach LLC:58739", "Hobby World:18852", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "MINDOK:7992", "Rebel Studio:47684"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167355", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4KSmlm59w0GwLIlgDnJDAQ__original/img/f0VmAKrPrMRQOUcOJHekRvuysDE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8211747.png", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4KSmlm59w0GwLIlgDnJDAQ__small/img/P20AxSqNHOEM5qT_doqeeE7JAHQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8211747.png"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsYOmvkgmqQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2DtUMOpfg0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK1aHtDMMc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCKNLHqUtJE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTnSTrDoZg4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoeU84SEsVw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUQt9EFf-9o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plF9--7dNbU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4G5RVwHpA0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuNQd_DXNUQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPSN0cXZa9Q", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59SxJGtqpss", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKhKM8d1w2s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKC1php1G3I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NfOVJoJQI8"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 5, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 5, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 13.63888888888889, "min_time": 90, "max_time": 180, "category": ["Adventure:1022", "Horror:1024", "Miniatures:1047", "Science Fiction:1016"], "mechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven:2018", "Cooperative Game:2023", "Dice Rolling:2072", "Hand Management:2040", "Hidden Roles:2891", "Interrupts:2837", "Modular Board:2011", "Player Elimination:2685", "Semi-Cooperative Game:2820", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Team-Based Game:2019", "Traitor Game:2814", "Variable Player Powers:2015"], "cooperative": true, "family": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler:59218", "Components: Dice with Icons:65328", "Components: Miniatures:25158", "Components: Polyhedral (not D6) dice:66140", "Creatures: Aliens / Extraterrestrials:5679", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Crowdfunding: Modian:77267", "Game: Nemesis:57925", "Misc: Eastar Game Manufacturing:78545", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666"], "expansion": ["Awaken Realms Vault: Story Dice \u2013 AR Board Game Dice Bundle Box:418446", "Nemesis: Achievement Cards:295927", "Nemesis: Aftermath:318351", "Nemesis: Aftermath & Void Seeders:256377", "Nemesis: Aftermath & Void Seeders & Medic:312736", "Nemesis: Blood Tests Deck:297911", "Nemesis: Carnomorphs:245845", "Nemesis: Crawl Deck:274532", "Nemesis: Feat Promo Cards:297660", "Nemesis: Medic Character Expansion:245846", "Nemesis: Story Dice Expansion \u2013 Intruder:386776", "Nemesis: Story Dice Expansion \u2013 Space Cat:386781", "Nemesis: Untold Stories #1:275277", "Nemesis: Untold Stories #2:310118", "Nemesis: Void Seeders:313790"], "rank": 25, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "thematic", "game_type_id": 5496, "name": "Thematic", "rank": 12, "bayes_rating": 7.94467}], "num_votes": 36341, "avg_rating": 8.25237, "stddev_rating": 1.52218, "bayes_rating": 7.95007, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.4878, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 3.25, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 167355, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers. The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.\n\nThe game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.\n\nDuring each round, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:\n\ntake a settlement tile and place it in the staging area on their player board\ntake a settlement tile from the staging area and place in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile,\ndeliver goods with a number matching one of their dice\ntake worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.\n\n\nIn addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile and place it in the staging area on their player board.\n\nThe game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.

It finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.\n\nAs a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal your forces and spies. War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis \u2013 Dune, the desert planet.\n\nYou start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents. As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.\n\nUnlike many deck building games, you don\u2019t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it\u2019s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you\u2019ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round\u2019s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.\n\nDefeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards. The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!\n\nSome important links: The Official FAQ, the Unofficial FAQ, and an Automa (solo and 2p) Overview", "designer": ["Paul Dennen:92370"], "artist": ["Clay Brooks:119957", "Brett Nienburg:155730", "Raul Ramos:73773", "Nate Storm:31001"], "publisher": ["Dire Wolf:33706", "Arclight Games:3475", "Broadway Toys LTD:9068", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "Geekach LLC:58739", "Lavka Games:34801", "Lucky Duck Games:33626", "MIPL:51614", "Reflexshop:36563", "REXhry:21053", "sternenschimmermeer:39249", "Tabletop KZ:55404", "YingDi (\u65c5\u6cd5\u5e08\u8425\u5730):48648"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PhjygpWSo-0labGrPBMyyg__original/img/mZzaBAEEJpMlHWWmC0R6Su0OibQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5666597.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PhjygpWSo-0labGrPBMyyg__small/img/JGgY-nBmkyB8WRp8vcoBLlNMQ5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5666597.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QlHsiDvdws", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QJO5ZCaJSI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfAeGDQr6s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnhmh2jv8Yg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gsJDXFD3Io", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFtYfeIeoAQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO3vipOrKe0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0PnjADHu8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ6hRkEbsXk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_zlsvZofag", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPcvAjO-1IM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZI5c91OJSw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6zuJVIRuYg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xha8eEDtG0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-81HSlM-T0"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 12.01388888888889, "min_time": 60, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme:1064", "Novel-based:1093", "Political:1001", "Science Fiction:1016"], "mechanic": ["Card Play Conflict Resolution:2857", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664", "Delayed Purchase:2901", "Force Commitment:2864", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Open Drafting:2041", "Ownership:2911", "Race:2876", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Tags:3100", "Take That:2686", "Turn Order: Progressive:2828", "Variable Player Powers:2015", "Worker Placement:2082"], "family": ["Books: Dune:5838", "Components: Meeples:79006", "Components: Multi-Use Cards:65191", "Digital Implementations: Dire Wolf Game Room:112176", "Digital Implementations: Google Play:78432", "Digital Implementations: Steam:77349", "Game: Dune: Imperium:79009", "Misc: LongPack Games:59705", "Misc: Watch It Played How To Videos:78198", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666"], "expansion": ["Dune: Imperium \u2013 Bloodlines:426129", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Boundless Ambition Promo Card:343598", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Duncan, Loyal Blade Promo Card:345692", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Immortality:367466", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Jessica of Arrakis Promo Card:326431", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Piter, Genius Advisor Promo Card:374597", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Pivotal Gambit Promo Card:441634", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Rise of Ix:342031", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Ruthless Leadership Promo Card:434489", "Dune: Imperium \u2013 Thumper Promo Card:392622"], "integration": [397598], "rank": 5, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 7, "bayes_rating": 8.21999}], "num_votes": 56534, "avg_rating": 8.41406, "stddev_rating": 1.28607, "bayes_rating": 8.22252, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.0739, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 2.942857142857143, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 316554, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

Sneak into an angry dragon's mountain lair to steal precious artifacts. Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow. Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!\n\nClank! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:\n\n\nSkill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.\nSwords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.\nBoots, which are used to move around the board.\n\n\nEvery time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they\u2019ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player\u2019s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.\n\nDuring the game, you have two goals:\n\nRetrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.\nAccumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!", "designer": ["Paul Dennen:92370"], "artist": ["Rayph Beisner:60376", "Raul Ramos:73773", "Nate Storm:31001"], "publisher": ["Dire Wolf:33706", "Renegade Game Studios:28072", "Arclight Games:3475", "Conclave Editora:11043", "Devir:2366", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lavka Games:34801", "Lucrum Games:27470", "Raven Distribution:3242", "Reflexshop:36563", "REXhry:21053", "Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844", "Tabletop KZ:55404"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201808", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DPjV1iI0ygo5Bl3XLNRiIg__original/img/cXqOdM3BLyIeRt0GP3M3V--gF1M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4449526.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DPjV1iI0ygo5Bl3XLNRiIg__small/img/O2WnqJew5gNjQqPUH3gqmTBc1pQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4449526.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHg63t1ragQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkyDLi_FiEo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zTMFyK5Yaw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEhRv-Qo1LE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvFtPe10kXU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO2v3P-JEw4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zO8ELERvNA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LUbYqDK0As", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USbllj77C6U", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSkTfbuIQsg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB_uSEs3QHc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ial6IqVpE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6SecONXFg0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeRKVSvwwrg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oIR8IxK1VM"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 8.348039215686274, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 60, "category": ["Adventure:1022", "Fantasy:1010"], "mechanic": ["Action Points:2001", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664", "Delayed Purchase:2901", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Movement Points:2947", "Open Drafting:2041", "Player Elimination:2685", "Point to Point Movement:2078", "Push Your Luck:2661", "Variable Set-up:2897"], "family": ["Category: Dungeon Crawler:59218", "Creatures: Dragons:7005", "Creatures: Goblins:22861", "Creatures: Monsters:5615", "Digital Implementations: Dire Wolf Game Room:112176", "Digital Implementations: Google Play:78432", "Digital Implementations: Steam:77349", "Game: Clank!:48927", "Misc: Mensa Select:6485", "Misc: Watch It Played How To Videos:78198", "Players: Games with expansions that add solo play:65851", "Players: Games with expansions that change player count:113768"], "expansion": ["Brettspiel Adventskalender 2017:231506", "Clank!

Gardeners tend the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls, and courtiers crowd the gates, pining for an audience that brings them closer to the innermost circles of the court. When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.\n\nIn The White Castle, players will control one of these clans in order to score more victory points than the rest. To do so, they must amass influence in the court, manage resources boldly, and place their workers in the right place at the right time. The authors are Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero, the duo known as Llama Dice who also designed the successful The Red Cathedral with Devir. In this case, we leave the Moscow of Ivan the Terrible behind to explore the most imposing fortress in modern Japan, Himeji Castle, where the banner of the Sakai clan flies under the orders of Daimyo Sakai Tadakiyo.\n\nThe White Castle is a Euro type game with mechanics of resource management, worker placement and dice placement to carry out actions. During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.\n\nThe central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimyo to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.\n\nWith accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups. As is tradition with Llama Dice titles, its sleek and simple design belies a great deal of strategic depth within the grasp of players.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["Isra C.:77002", "Shei S.:77173"], "artist": ["Joan Guardiet:32071"], "publisher": ["Devir:2366", "999 Games:267", "Banana Games:35928", "CMON Global Limited:21608", "GaGa Games:29194", "Games4you:52408", "Games7Days:48438", "IELLO:8923", "KOSMOS:37", "Lautapelit.fi:3218", "Portal Games:2726", "Reflexshop:36563", "TLAMA games:41423"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/371942", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qXT1U-nFh9PE8ujfdmI7dA__original/img/jzmifZJ0Sg2Js7hmQjzX7bEHVBY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7754663.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qXT1U-nFh9PE8ujfdmI7dA__small/img/ru1l95gdKNXSsByDglE9Xxgu0kE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7754663.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta1NIRSY4EQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPLIM2D_vS4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMit62ZxMnk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Onqo9_Wrcw8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsr4_02o-iY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIrKVSm1Cxw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9RsS3Yx128", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmCysdeeSJI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7BLxnCHt-o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i0QfPCzt5Q", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDpQO-45ZFk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2caKn8brW-o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgrczdj9d_c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GjQbKOwuK4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALNt0p7-W2E"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 12.049019607843137, "min_time": 80, "max_time": 80, "category": ["Dice:1017", "Economic:1021"], "mechanic": ["Action Drafting:2838", "Area Movement:2046", "Dice Rolling:2072", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Income:2902", "Melding and Splaying:2981", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Open Drafting:2041", "Race:2876", "Resource Queue:3103", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Variable Set-up:2897", "Worker Placement:2082", "Worker Placement with Dice Workers:2935"], "family": ["Animals: Birds:45672", "Components: Control Boards:66553", "Country: Japan:10634", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Digital Implementations: Yucata:70354", "Mechanism: Dice Drafting:65163", "Series: Small Box Euros (Devir):99601", "Theme: Samurai:28732"], "expansion": ["Gisei (fan expansion for The White Castle):446700", "The White Castle: Matcha:420321", "The White Castle: Promo 1:401788", "The White Castle: Promo 2:402959", "The White Castle: Promo 3:430051", "The White Castle: Promo 5:453047"], "rank": 76, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 66, "bayes_rating": 7.70409}], "num_votes": 20640, "avg_rating": 7.98435, "stddev_rating": 1.20416, "bayes_rating": 7.67128, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.053, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 1.013157894736842, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 371942, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

After several lean decades, family fortunes are looking up! Your goal is to improve your estate so as to be in better standing with the truly influential families in Derbyshire.\n\nObsession is a game of 16 to 20 turns in which players build a deck of Victorian gentry (British social upper class), renovate their estate by acquiring building tiles from a centralized builders' market, and manipulate an extensive service staff of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and footmen utilizing a novel worker placement mechanic. Successfully hosting prestigious social activities such as Fox Hunts, Music Recitals, Billiards, Political Debates, and Grand Balls increases a player's wealth, reputation, and connections among the elite.\n\nEach turn, players choose a building tile representing a room or outdoor space in and around their 19th century British country house. The tile chosen dictates the event that can be hosted and the guests to be invited. Players must carefully plan, however, to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed. The reward for success is new investment opportunities, permitting further renovation of the estate (acquisition of more valuable/powerful building tiles), an increase in reputation in the county, an expanding circle of influential acquaintances, and a larger and highly-trained domestic staff.\n\nThroughout the game, a competitive courtship for the hand of the most eligible young gentleman and lady in the county presents specific renovation and reputation objectives. The player who best meets these objectives while accumulating victory points will win the hand of the wealthy love interest and the game.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["Dan Hallagan:102328"], "artist": ["Dan Hallagan:102328"], "publisher": ["Kayenta Games:36949", "4GAMES:54051", "Boardgame Mall:48941", "CMON Global Limited:21608", "Giochix.it:7251", "Lucrum Games:27470", "Maldito Games:30677", "Strohmann Games:45845", "Super Meeple:29409", "TTGames CZ:56411"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/231733", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__original/img/uArsqbWyUALa982zGWsy8QQWnjE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5902073.png", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__small/img/eTnMwfCC2jCGDPXC08SIaMXNOTM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5902073.png"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg4KaCsn2hQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJP1PJR3BGg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcPuRDIf7_E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntAuxKL5pdI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbwLFlUjgRc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daPg_eSR2_Q", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95J3xYwMW0c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnRmt3Ob9s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHkD8ACYJwM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWSYQsOdu6g", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5orIz0d4L8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFFEcDmdflo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO1Hmbn_5mE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIbBAm52f7o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbUNHdX5U84"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 2, "max_players_best": 2, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 12.287878787878787, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 90, "category": ["Post-Napoleonic:2710"], "mechanic": ["Action Retrieval:2839", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664", "Hand Management:2040", "Open Drafting:2041", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819"], "family": ["Components: Meeples:79006", "Country: England:14759", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Game: Obsession:57478", "History: Regency Era:113101", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Theme: Love / Romance:61207"], "expansion": ["Obsession: Characters Expansion:397067", "Obsession: Dice Tower Family Board Promo:459145", "Obsession: Dice Tower Promo Guests:405786", "Obsession: Dice Tower Sporting Tile:432656", "Obsession: Promotional Cards:284466", "Obsession: Promotional Tiles:306634", "Obsession: Upstairs, Downstairs:279067", "Obsession: Useful Box:338349", "Obsession: Wessex Expansion:245392", "\u041e\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b \u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0438 (Obsession: Gentry Promo Cards):460841"], "rank": 66, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "thematic", "game_type_id": 5496, "name": "Thematic", "rank": 22, "bayes_rating": 7.76225}, {"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 51, "bayes_rating": 7.76375}], "num_votes": 17159, "avg_rating": 8.08022, "stddev_rating": 1.34541, "bayes_rating": 7.71216, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.1078, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 2.9411764705882355, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 231733, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf\u00e9 into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf\u00e9 become the Grand Austria Hotel.\n\nThe start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.\n\nBut no hotel can grow without guests.

The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment of Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony. As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company\u2019s private agenda. In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface. As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food \u2014 the necessities for survival. Do you dare take part in humankind\u2019s biggest challenge?\n\nOn Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase \u200band the Shuttle Phase\u200b.\n\nDuring the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet\u2019s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.\n\nAll buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony\u2019s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.\n\nDuring the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.", "designer": ["Vital Lacerda:12396"], "artist": ["Ian O'Toole:64844"], "publisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games:597", "Angry Lion Games:38809", "Arclight Games:3475", "Delta Vision Publishing:6194", "Giochix.it:7251", "hobbity.eu:10562", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lavka Games:34801", "Maldito Games:30677", "Mosaico Jogos:44349", "Skellig Games:40058", "TLAMA games:41423", "YOKA Games:8147"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/184267", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__original/img/GNjjsgxq7wYO9pSIteDJe6Sxt00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4357658.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__small/img/4GFbhkEWyIublXmikE2Tep6wSIQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4357658.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeVIvj_DkRA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syIfByRwEjk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZeDo9vE2Zc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvPc_DUaC-w", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1DNuK39nWA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ck6nurIisQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFWHap9c71s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SIg8YG0jW4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEbAvVC-bpc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyk0JpdEiKw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deJtDtpyqFM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eCWbVa0JC0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45MZARrjudc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKuJ_afXZoo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYExTXVtyio"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 14.220930232558139, "min_time": 90, "max_time": 150, "category": ["City Building:1029", "Economic:1021", "Exploration:1020", "Science Fiction:1016", "Space Exploration:1113", "Territory Building:1086"], "mechanic": ["Contracts:2912", "Delayed Purchase:2901", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Hexagon Grid:2026", "Income:2902", "Movement Points:2947", "Moving Multiple Units:2958", "Set Collection:2004", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849", "Tile Placement:2002", "Variable Phase Order:2079", "Worker Placement:2082"], "family": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Game: On Mars:76261", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Space: Colonization / Extraterrestrial Colonisation:111131", "Space: Earth's Solar System:19298", "Space: Mars:10169"], "expansion": ["On Mars: Alien Invasion:278241", "On Mars: Beacon Promo Card:278431", "On Mars: Upgrade Pack:296981"], "rank": 56, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 44, "bayes_rating": 7.82173}], "num_votes": 14568, "avg_rating": 8.16482, "stddev_rating": 1.51788, "bayes_rating": 7.74183, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 4.6287, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 184267, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available \u2014 unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.\n\nIdeally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's. At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife. Maybe hawks want to be separate from other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears want to be in pairs.

They are superior vehicles due to them being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and cheaper to run. They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion-engine counterparts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them.\n\nYou will be overseeing the production of these vehicles in Kanban EV, with \"kanban\" (\u770b\u677f) being the name for a scheduling system that supports an efficient assembly line, just-in-time production, and a smooth workflow process. Over the course of the game, players take on the role of rookie employees who are trying to secure their career. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve and innovate automobile parts, and get your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production and impress the factory manager.\n\nYou must make shrewd use of the recycling facilities and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate parts when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes. Sandra, the factory manager, will review your performance and keep the factory on tempo.\n\nKanban EV is a game that focuses on resource and time management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for factory goals and the highest level of promotion. You earn production points (PP) for performing various actions in the game, and the player with the most PP at the end of the game wins.\n\n\u2014description from publisher\n\nIncludes solo mode by D\u00e1vid Turczi", "designer": ["Vital Lacerda:12396"], "artist": ["Ian O'Toole:64844"], "publisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games:597", "Arclight Games:3475", "Delta Vision Publishing:6194", "Editions Philibert:44140", "Geekach LLC:58739", "Giochix.it:7251", "hobbity.eu:10562", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lavka Games:34801", "Maldito Games:30677", "Skellig Games:40058", "TLAMA games:41423", "YOKA Games:8147"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284378", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L2Wn-zUqkcHgqvwvY212Ig__original/img/Htra4hvxjBlejtNEIUns_B3CNNc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4924232.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L2Wn-zUqkcHgqvwvY212Ig__small/img/RQunBacBw949DkYBgzoS5YaXgJo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4924232.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6-qBieOIGg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PBpqgOOA0o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srdrOi3zejA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FGWXZjt7wg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCctSqdcrUk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbWsuBKNw3k", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouY1qeOuiK8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlGF6BKZu9c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqtbUQWLW3E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWDuAARA4KE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tY21BrClPs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ7chXo87ww", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1PBTa1O3tM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWWROgfw7I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4RNujuDO_w"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 13.875, "min_time": 60, "max_time": 180, "category": ["Economic:1021", "Industry / Manufacturing:1088"], "mechanic": ["Action Points:2001", "Hand Management:2040", "Variable Phase Order:2079", "Worker Placement:2082"], "family": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Theme: Automotive Industry:21991"], "expansion": ["Kanban EV: Upgrade Pack:321238"], "implementation": [109276], "rank": 47, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 28, "bayes_rating": 7.91683}], "num_votes": 9831, "avg_rating": 8.37772, "stddev_rating": 1.31293, "bayes_rating": 7.79274, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 4.2993, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 284378, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous \"baddie\" responsible.\n\nTeam up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle.", "designer": ["Josh J.

You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today \u2014 a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.\n\nWhen the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.\nIn what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason the people of these times became such strong seafarers was their unfortunate agricultural situation: crop shortfalls caused great distress.\n\nIn this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also engage in the day-to-day activity of collecting goods with which to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.\n\n--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer's review:\nA Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with a plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risks balanced against rewards. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.\n\nEach year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.\n\nAt the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.\n\nYou will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you\u2019re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you\u2019re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.\n\nUPC 681706716909", "designer": ["Uwe Rosenberg:10"], "artist": ["Dennis Lohausen:12484"], "publisher": ["Feuerland Spiele:22380", "Cranio Creations:10768", "Devir:2366", "Filosofia \u00c9ditions:5657", "Game Harbor:12540", "Hobby World:18852", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lacerta:5812", "Maldito Games:30677", "Mandala Jogos:35035", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "Super Meeple:29409", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (TendaysGames):22609", "TLAMA games:41423", "White Goblin Games:4932", "Z-Man Games:538"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177736", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__original/img/N1X-0JB1GapFVhl98nP4tNFXMcM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3146943.png", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__small/img/AKxMMz2DTbBrEynhDROla8fdjJ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3146943.png"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOku4wmFEGE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z6TXy65ddw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thbPyGNTAGo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Rgvg75hFM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Huxmk8Ibg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1JaWvOK5Vw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKcv1YpPNis", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPxeyNyZKLk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiqghcuNr68", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emA0H41SDRM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I63QwEoJ44g", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7xST9-kSis", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAqQOMwVsZ8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iulm1kErwU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSYJpoYR6PQ"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 12.31578947368421, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Animals:1089", "Farming:1013", "Industry / Manufacturing:1088", "Medieval:1035", "Puzzle:1028"], "mechanic": ["Action Points:2001", "Automatic Resource Growth:2903", "Dice Rolling:2072", "Enclosure:2043", "Grid Coverage:2978", "Hand Management:2040", "Income:2902", "Layering:3001", "Pattern Recognition:2060", "Push Your Luck:2661", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Square Grid:2940", "Tile Placement:2002", "Turn Order: Pass Order:2830", "Worker Placement:2082"], "family": ["Animals: Cattle / Cows:7530", "Animals: Fish / Fishes:7975", "Animals: Moose / Elk:74574", "Animals: Sheep:7481", "Components: Polyhedral (not D6) dice:66140", "Components: Polyominoes:24571", "Components: Wooden pieces & boards:68769", "Country: Iceland:10314", "Country: Norway:10312", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Game: A Feast for Odin:54213", "History: Viking Expansion:58138", "Islands: Greenland (Denmark):62614", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Mythology: Norse:62773", "Occupation: Farmer:69363", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Region: Arctic:12809", "Series: Harvest (Uwe Rosenberg):3866", "Theme: Food / Cooking:5841", "Theme: Vikings:5613"], "expansion": ["Deutscher Spielepreis 2017 Goodie Box:232298", "A Feast for Odin: Lofoten, Orkney, and Tierra del Fuego:236902", "A Feast for Odin: Mini Expansion #2:292592", "A Feast for Odin: New Special Tiles:240522", "A Feast for Odin: The Norwegians:216788", "Valhalla (fan expansion for A Feast for Odin):414098"], "rank": 26, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 23, "bayes_rating": 7.96955}], "num_votes": 32678, "avg_rating": 8.16383, "stddev_rating": 1.37841, "bayes_rating": 7.94285, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.8663, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 2.86, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 177736, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

Will you play as the Fellowship of the Ring to defend the free races and destroy the One Ring? Or will you play as Sauron and pursue Frodo and Sam while deploying your hordes to the gates of the enemy cities? The destiny of Middle-earth is in your hands!\n\nA game plays over 3 successive chapters that unfold similarly.\nOn your turn, strengthen your Skills, hoard your treasure, stretch your presence across Middle-earth, rally Races to your cause, or advance the Quest of the Ring.\n\n\n\nTurn OverviewIn each chapter players take cards from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's available, that is not partially covered by any other cards. Players can either play the card, paying its cost and placing it in their play area, obtaining its benefit, or discard the card and take as many coins from the reserve as the current chapter.\n\nPlayers can also take a Landmark tile from one of the faceup tiles, paying its cost placing it in their play area.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, and by: discovering new technologies, electing competent leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages, beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is 'built' in the same manner as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with a stronger military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a strong military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.", "designer": ["Vlaada Chv\u00e1til:789"], "artist": ["Filip Murmak:114458", "Radim Pech:11938", "Jakub Politzer:94497", "Milan Vavro\u0148:11961"], "publisher": ["Czech Games Edition:7345", "Cranio Creations:10768", "Devir:2366", "DiceTree Games:23205", "Eagle-Gryphon Games:597", "Feelindigo:36981", "GaGa Games:29194", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "HaKubia:23382", "HeidelB\u00c4R Games:38505", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264", "IELLO:8923", "MINDOK:7992", "New Games Order, LLC:9881", "One Moment Games:30552", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182028", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fVwPntkJKgaEo0rIC0RwpA__original/img/1jawNpljTXwnT4km_2CjGwoUPR8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2663291.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fVwPntkJKgaEo0rIC0RwpA__small/img/31usGlzlBReEFf60bcgbvDTjwCg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2663291.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEHH1xLaJ4M", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtA_m0mEGSs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPy6R83eK_o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5vPjtGcrE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLiJuiMkACk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo8k324nG2k", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKTzL6caYDI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHsspi7vnJY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOBl4LBiTkU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzxujZpCYAk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjK2L7-XjgQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mjIwszAgVs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZv9ZTiObc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFEZzHpLvMk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jieLoc0GZvs"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 13.977272727272727, "min_time": 120, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Card Game:1002", "Civilization:1015", "Economic:1021"], "mechanic": ["Action Points:2001", "Auction / Bidding:2012", "Auction: Dutch:2924", "Events:2850", "Income:2902", "Open Drafting:2041", "Player Elimination:2685", "Tags:3100", "Take That:2686"], "family": ["Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Google Play:78432", "Digital Implementations: Steam:77349", "Game: Through the Ages:57498", "Historical Figures: Various:76973", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Misc: BGG Hall of Fame:109134", "Theme: Colonial:21622"], "expansion": ["Through the Ages: New Leaders and Wonders:280833"], "implementation": [25613], "rank": 16, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 13, "bayes_rating": 8.05134}], "num_votes": 34368, "avg_rating": 8.25392, "stddev_rating": 1.53041, "bayes_rating": 8.02102, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 4.44, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 4.019607843137255, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 182028, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.\n\nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed from among 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.\n\nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these strategies are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empires, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.\n\nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them over the course of the game. Each player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, achievement of which provides victory points--only for the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective.

The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town\u2019s prosperity.\n\nWork the Land\nWhether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you\u2019d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.\n\nTools of the Trade\nAt the outset of each half year, you\u2019ll choose how you\u2019d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal, focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock, or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and shear your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year, you\u2019ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals, so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!\n\nTravel and Prosper\nOnce you\u2019ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods, it's time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have, the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game. Build up your farm and your vehicles and get your goods out into the world to make the most of every season. There are many roads to success in Fields of Arle, so pick your path, work the land, and enjoy the friendly competition as you strive to make your fortune!\n\n- from the publisher's website",

The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival. During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a \"choose your own adventure\" style journey through various events and encounters. Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive. If your party lives, you'll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.\n\nMonster AI System\nEach of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it's HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.\n\nGear System\nIn Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.\n\nStory Event System\n40+ Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign. Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make.\n\nStory Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story. Some are triggered directly from the timeline and others from choices you make in game.", "designer": ["Adam Poots:25578"], "artist": ["Zeen Chin:107952", "Lokman Lam:67928", "Lorinda Tomko:66627"],

Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.\n\nThe aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["S J Macdonald:103821", "Shem Phillips:12547"], "artist": ["Mihajlo Dimitrievski:70533"], "publisher": ["Garphill Games:9459", "Renegade Game Studios:28072", "Banana Games:35928", "CMON Global Limited:21608", "Fever Games:27480", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lavka Games:34801", "Lord of Boards:46500", "Meeple:49615", "MeepleBR:32591", "Pixie Games:30034", "Portal Games:2726", "Primigenio:30490", "Reflexshop:36563", "Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844", "TLAMA games:41423", "White Goblin Games:4932", "\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b1\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb (KenBill):37975"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266810", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__original/img/9ktZDu003VVVTw0RxD-ufLYV1HQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4462987.png", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__small/img/1gEbke_bKTA6D2jjpPm1HowGGHM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4462987.png"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjWNtQKWyNI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC__WCTI1BM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNBOjXdWzPI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsnbhnPb59Y", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYkFHNNLAFA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDNH1Nk7soc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkzWxZSC7X0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6EGSbfyJXM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYdIC4pHthM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_3QaZLyna8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6ZpJnxyZ8E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVaTMlK5Kw4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McPGTBhyKnk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UADeVF3lCmw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbJxOtT39iw"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 3, "min_players_best": 2, "max_players_best": 2, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 13.787878787878787, "min_time": 90, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Medieval:1035"], "mechanic": ["End Game Bonuses:2875", "Market:2900", "Open Drafting:2041", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Worker Placement:2082", "Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"], "family": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "History: Francia:58598", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Series: Medieval Trilogies (Garphill Games):79098", "Series: The West Kingdom Trilogy (Garphill Games):53400"], "expansion": ["Level Up Loot 2:290834", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: 2019 Promos:274782", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: City of Crowns:317980", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: Dice Tower 2021 Pack:329073", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: King Dan:304626", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: Meeple Folk:295660", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: Player Suspicion Decks:432453", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: Principi Promo Card:430463", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: Suzerain:330372", "Paladins of the West Kingdom: The Vassals Mini-Expansion:327244", "West Kingdom Mini Card Set:293647", "The West Kingdom Tomesaga:296152", "West Kingdom Trilogy: Promo Pack 2:454506"], "rank": 78, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 61, "bayes_rating": 7.71541}], "num_votes": 20129, "avg_rating": 7.95933, "stddev_rating": 1.24696, "bayes_rating": 7.66258, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.7119, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 2.0681818181818183, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 266810, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal \u2014 Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo \u2014 was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.\n\nLisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon. During the planning of the downtown project, the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined. The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game, making each game a totally different experience. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and whoever gathers the most wigs by the end of the game wins.\n\nLisboa is played in rounds. Each round, all players play one turn. They may place one card on their display or replace one card from this display. During the game, players schedule hearings to get character favors, such as commerce, construction, and openings. The iconic buildings score the stores and stores provide income to the players. Players need to manage influence, construction licenses, store permits, church power, workers and money, with the workers' cost being dependent on the prestige of the players.", "designer": ["Vital Lacerda:12396"], "artist": ["Ian O'Toole:64844"], "publisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games:597", "Angry Lion Games:38809", "Delta Vision Publishing:6194", "Giochix.it:7251", "hobbity.eu:10562", "Lavka Games:34801", "Maldito Games:30677", "Mandala Jogos:35035", "TLAMA games:41423", "YOKA Games:8147"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161533", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OrHS8_a1CqSGiXeTfCk0Wg__original/img/hVArRkZYHiPTGTfi0DPR58i4o44=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3209553.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OrHS8_a1CqSGiXeTfCk0Wg__small/img/ZBTT0qZcD5HMFlhFN7PLMe6zXvg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3209553.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH5fNFc7kJ8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=571kNCtKVA8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nioit1UWDII", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HZGRrcHVs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chr9z_8QyTU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwBSvEoaVYU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1hTkt2WjI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3cjaQdBv2o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZxSvZ9Si58", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPNbIdna4wM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Y1yG0ZLkc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75jAwHoGlzQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfPee3GPOr0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcxh32ZUkgM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQvtO7lUTkY"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 14.18, "min_time": 60, "max_time": 120, "category": ["City Building:1029", "Economic:1021", "Industry / Manufacturing:1088", "Political:1001"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence:2080", "Hand Management:2040", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Open Drafting:2041", "Set Collection:2004", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Tile Placement:2002"], "family": ["Cities: Lisbon (Portugal):43603", "Components: Multi-Use Cards:65191", "Country: Portugal:5614", "Crowdfunding: Giochistarter:25292", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter:8374", "Crowdfunding: Spieleschmiede:22135", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Misc: Made by Panda:78680", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Theme: Earthquakes:73380"], "expansion": ["Lisboa: Queen Variant:301771"], "rank": 68, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 45, "bayes_rating": 7.80738}], "num_votes": 12615, "avg_rating": 8.17056, "stddev_rating": 1.45963, "bayes_rating": 7.71009, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 4.5746, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 161533, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

You and your fellow medical graduates have been recruited by the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to neutralize enemy agents, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.\n\nCombatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it's not the only threat you'll encounter in the field. Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won't be without backup. Coordinate with other covert operatives for assistance and make strategic use of these teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.\n\nDesigned as a prequel, Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 does not require you to have completed Season 1 and Season 2 before diving into this Cold War spy thriller. As in the first two Pandemic Legacy games, each time you play brings new cards, rules, and conditions that affect future games. Each alias you create will gain contacts and other assets to execute your plans more smoothly. And, of course, the CIA will be watching and evaluating your performance in the field. Work together with your fellow agents to prevent this new bio-threat \u2014 the fate of the world depends on it. Can you save humanity once again?\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["Rob Daviau:442", "Matt Leacock:378"], "artist": ["Dan Gerlach:128614", "Monica Helland:128613", "Atha Kanaani:80022", "Samuel R.

The game draws inspiration from current or emerging technologies and efforts in space exploration.Players will explore nearby planets and their moons by launching probes from Earth while taking advantage of ever-shifting planetary positions. Decide whether to land on their surface to collect valuable samples, or stay in orbit for a broader survey. Additionally, by directing your telescopes to gaze into distant star systems, you may detect traces of alien signals or undiscovered exoplanets, and collect promising data to examine and study back home.\n\nBack on Earth, you can invest in upgrading your equipment so you can analyze incoming data more efficiently, boost your telescope signal capacity, or increase your supply of resources\u2014all to expand the scope of your search that could lead to a discovery of extraterrestrial life forms. Finding traces of extraterrestrial life is only a matter of time \u2014 utilize the resources you have at your disposal strategically and you may well end up being the one to make the biggest scientific contribution towards advancing our understanding of alien life within our galaxy.\n\nYou will also make use of over 200 cards to aid your efforts or focus your research in a particular direction for additional bonuses and rewards. Each card has unique effects and illustrations and depicts real-life technologies, projects, and discoveries (like the ISS, Large Hadron Collider, Perseverance rover, Voyager probe, and many more).\n\nThe game is played in 5 rounds. The player with the starting player marker takes the first turn of the round. Players take turns in clockwise order, skipping any players that have already passed for the round. At the end of round 5, the final score is calculated and the player with the most points wins.\n\nSETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence pays homage to space and planetary exploration, astronomy, the ongoing search for signs of life in the vastness of space, and efforts to understand the nature of life in the universe.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["Tom\u00e1\u0161 Holek:135378"], "artist": ["Ond\u0159ej Hrdina:115373", "Oto Kandera:160646", "Ji\u0159\u00ed K\u016fs:127825", "Jakub Lang:160644", "Michaela Loveck\u00e1:160643", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Mikovec:145646", "Jakub Politzer:94497", "Petra Rame\u0161ov\u00e1:160645", "Franti\u0161ek Sedl\u00e1\u010dek:119983", "Petr \u0160tich:113177", "Petr \u0160tich (III):160642", "Josef Sur\u00fd:160641"], "publisher": ["Czech Games Edition:7345", "Broadway Toys LTD:9068", "Cranio Creations:10768", "Devir:2366", "DiceTree Games:23205", "DSV Games:54949", "Feelindigo:36981", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "HeidelB\u00c4R Games:38505", "Hobby Japan:1391", "IELLO:8923", "MINDOK:7992", "MIPL:51614", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/418059", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_BUXOVRDU9g_eRwgpR5ZZw__original/img/28ob2JiASW8iX8XoVzp5Y25-h24=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8160466.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_BUXOVRDU9g_eRwgpR5ZZw__small/img/icamIZ4nP3HHH3vczZqTr1hQgKY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8160466.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgzV4x3UktM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoIQ4-na_-Y", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPq8fDR-zw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L_Wuqb32jg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfXfM_XT1-o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioG4ZI5LjdE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TektvgdQwSc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7Y2KbhlAB4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naTPphUdkZk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFO93kYkbME", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o6jsury7pw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUqoBng_Vls", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dorb30sDHg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmt8DVNNp1E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s90BCWmhsQQ"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 13.8125, "min_time": 40, "max_time": 160, "category": ["Science Fiction:1016", "Space Exploration:1113"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence:2080", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Income:2902", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Resource to Move:2948", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Turn Order: Progressive:2828", "Variable Set-up:2897"], "family": ["Components: RE-Wood:109412", "Creatures: Aliens / Extraterrestrials:5679", "Misc: GettingGames Tutorial Videos:106729", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Space: Earth's Solar System:19298", "Theme: Astronomy:66108", "Theme: Science:66167"], "expansion": ["SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence \u2013 DLR Promo Card:456891", "SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence \u2013 Gateway to Mars Promo Card:437940", "SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence \u2013 Pluto Promo Card:430027", "SETI: Space Agencies:445048", "SETI: Space Agencies \u2013 Space Agencies Promo Card:453310"], "rank": 18, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 15, "bayes_rating": 8.04082}], "num_votes": 16376, "avg_rating": 8.409, "stddev_rating": 1.26403, "bayes_rating": 7.97268, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.8135, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 3.125, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 418059, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions before they start to fight in earnest: this is represented by the Political Track which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.\n\nThe game can be won by a military victory if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ring bearer: while the armies clash across Middle-earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle-earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ring bearer from harm with an attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow so that they do not overrun Middle-earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can perform during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies or characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.", "designer": ["Roberto Di Meglio:3247", "Marco Maggi:934", "Francesco Nepitello:935"], "artist": ["John Howe:11884", "Fabio Maiorana:20670"], "publisher": ["Ares Games:17917", "Angry Lion Games:38809", "Devir:2366", "GaGa Games:29194", "Galakta:4617", "Geekach LLC:58739", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264", "Nuts!

During each mission it is not the number of tricks but the right tricks at the right time that count.\n\nThe team completes a mission only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks.\n\nThe game comes with 50 missions, with three additional missions published in spielbox 2/2020.", "designer": ["Thomas Sing:45563"], "artist": ["Marco Armbruster:120549", "Sensit Communication GmbH:72568"], "publisher": ["KOSMOS:37", "999 Games:267", "Black Sea Games:43382", "Brain Games:7162", "CoolPlay:50696", "Devir:2366", "Galakta:4617", "Geekach LLC:58739", "Giochi Uniti:5530", "GP Games:21640", "HaKubia:23382", "Ideal Board Games:8822", "IELLO:8923", "Igroljub:31372", "Kaissa Chess & Games:6214", "Korea Boardgames:8291", "Lautapelit.fi:3218", "MINDOK:7992", "NeoTroy Games:32395", "Piatnik:22", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234", "Thames & Kosmos:60627", "Zvezda:1466"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284083", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/98LnQShydr11OBKS46xY-Q__original/img/Q-ZkgnuBu9OTBr7J3qnqPjqamAE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5687013.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/98LnQShydr11OBKS46xY-Q__small/img/et-fnuozyOdBOVL-5kSS3_7I8fw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5687013.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBAR4qd2jAE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGAJfzmAjRo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdTQ9hjDdqI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8OqC9sPT1c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP-FYhvfpFg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDEU-DD1Arg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic_E2_CXYSo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ_kaHMNmGM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK06LlGkPmY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxanZRfzS0g", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcGtl0YYfY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnXUyBakFAU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqaUQ1JZxto", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1i383DUGrg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nhNeoEUWuE"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 5, "min_players_rec": 3, "max_players_rec": 5, "min_players_best": 4, "max_players_best": 4, "min_age": 10, "min_age_rec": 10.0, "min_time": 20, "max_time": 20, "category": ["Card Game:1002", "Science Fiction:1016", "Space Exploration:1113"], "mechanic": ["Communication Limits:2893", "Cooperative Game:2023", "Hand Management:2040", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822", "Trick-taking:2009"], "cooperative": true, "family": ["Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: BrettspielWelt:76458", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia:70948", "Game: The Crew:63179", "Mechanism: Artificial Player:71181", "Misc: LongPack Games:59705", "Space: Earth's Solar System:19298"], "expansion": ["The Crew: Flight to the ISS:307204", "The Crew: The Deimos Adventure:311184"], "rank": 89, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "familygames", "game_type_id": 5499, "name": "Family Game", "rank": 14, "bayes_rating": 7.64683}], "num_votes": 47596, "avg_rating": 7.7621, "stddev_rating": 1.31761, "bayes_rating": 7.62297, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 1.9629, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 1.25, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 284083, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with friends throughout your campaign. It's easy to swap players in and out at will. Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you'll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way.\n\nSleeping Gods is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.\n\nSleeping Gods is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.\n\nIt's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.\n\nYou can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.\n\nCaverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources.

Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's \"A-cards\"; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.\n\nAll of the nearly 220 cards \u2014 whether special or basic \u2014 are divided into five types according to the way and time of use.

With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities.

Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:\n\n\nThey allow a player to choose actions during the game.\nThey are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.\n\n\nConcordia is a strategy game that requires advanced planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds their 15th house, the game ends.

The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.\n\nFrosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign. Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.\n\nIn addition to using the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven features other elements, such as mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how the ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.\n\nFrosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanism for bringing items over from 'Gloomhaven'. However, as Frosthaven's outpost is a remote location, these products may be imported but are not present as standard items. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buying them.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["Isaac Childres:69802"], "artist": ["Francesca Baerald:79079", "David Demaret:66266", "Alexandr Elichev:77084", "Josh T.

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.\n\nAs a player, you acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to your hand. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards and actually playing them. Standard Projects are always available to complement your hand of cards. Your basic income, as well as your basic score, are based on your Terraform Rating. However, your income is boosted by your production, and VPs are also gained from many other sources.\n\nYou keep track of your production and resources on your player board. The game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation and consists of the following phases:\n\n1) Player order shifts clockwise.\n2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.\n3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.\n4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.\n\nWhen the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their required levels, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Combine your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!", "designer": ["Jacob Fryxelius:52075"], "artist": ["Isaac Fryxelius:62819", "Daniel Fryxelius:52076"], "publisher":

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\n\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\n\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.\n\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round.

Playing through the 5-part campaign unlocks additional contents, and once all contents have been unlocked, the game can be replayed indefinitely.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player gets a set of citizen cards, a tribe board, as well as a huge dual-layer player board. The tribe board shows your unique tribe ability and the ancient technologies that you may relearn during the game. The dual-layer player board is where you place your custom machines and upgrade your card slots.\n\nA main goal of the game is to reach and populate the large ancient sites. These ancient locations are randomized, and as they are important sources of victory points, they will shape your strategy differently each game. The game ends when all artifacts have been taken, and the player with the most points wins.\n\nOn your turn you take two actions:\n\nPlay a card (its effect is determined by which card slot you use)\nExplore (reveal an area tile and recruit a new citizen card)\nPopulate (populate an ancient location to learn a new technology)\nBuild factory (the adjacent terrains determine which machine tracks you advance)", "designer": ["Helge Meissner:109214", "Kristian Amundsen \u00d8stby:4063", "Eilif Svensson:9637", "Anna Wermlund:109215"], "artist": ["Gjermund Bohne:76491", "Martin Mottet:119304", "Dan Roff:134667", "Jessy T\u00f6pfer:141504"], "publisher": ["Aporta Games:27674", "Across the Board:39686", "BGA Plus:51066", "Board Game Rookie:44580", "Boardgame Mall:48941", "Devir:2366", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "Ghenos Games:4785", "Hobby Japan:1391", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd:9325", "Matagot:5400", "MINDOK:7992", "Pegasus Spiele:39", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "Surfin' Meeple China:36763"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/332772", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0OZ9QR0pC9G5t5i9MoZTQ__original/img/NxxAoxVxMNkDGEkD3aoobPL14dI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6950224.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0OZ9QR0pC9G5t5i9MoZTQ__small/img/NPtXuKlsnfPORSn6kpTcf-ZdEF0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6950224.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmv-WhnRbaM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY0uSztWxMY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgTtKDjxkbo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw__iqc5xdE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryEdVn_JrVw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3A2F-UeA0I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBD5Gno6-o8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIAY3vatkqg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM9wGJBUAmw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpNI-vPWoZg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fbd3KtbJNk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSooWNX2OBU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag6jmugnUk4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQTlh4Ekujk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWAxoJxCwj4"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 13.66, "min_time": 90, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Civilization:1015", "Industry / Manufacturing:1088", "Science Fiction:1016"], "mechanic": ["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664", "Hexagon Grid:2026", "Map Addition:2959", "Network and Route Building:2081", "Open Drafting:2041", "Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822", "Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849", "Variable Player Powers:2015"], "family": ["Components: Multi-Use Cards:65191", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Game: Revive:111921", "Mechanism: Campaign Games:24281", "Mechanism: Tableau Building:27646"], "expansion": ["Revive: Call of the Abyss:385685", "Revive: Dice Tower Promo Pack:433208"], "rank": 90, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 64, "bayes_rating": 7.71133}], "num_votes": 12099, "avg_rating": 8.07107, "stddev_rating": 1.224, "bayes_rating": 7.61946, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.4579, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 1.8888888888888888, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 332772, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:33+0000"},

Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.\n\nBy powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...\n\nAnachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them \u2014 and both are in short supply.\n\nThe game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs \u2014 unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past \"self\" with resources.

With a variety of worker actions, artifacts, and equipment cards, the set-up for each game will be unique, encouraging players to explore new strategies to meet the challenge.\n\nDiscover the Lost Ruins of Arnak!\n\n\u2014description from the publisher", "designer": ["Elwen:127823", "M\u00edn:127822"], "artist": ["Ond\u0159ej Hrdina:115373", "Ji\u0159\u00ed K\u016fs:127825", "Filip Murmak:114458", "Jakub Politzer:94497", "Franti\u0161ek Sedl\u00e1\u010dek:119983", "Milan Vavro\u0148:11961"], "publisher": ["Czech Games Edition:7345", "Br\u00e4dspel.se:46980", "Cranio Creations:10768", "Devir:2366", "DiceTree Games:23205", "Fantasmagoria:22560", "GaGa Games:29194", "Games4you:52408", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.:8820", "Goblin Gaming:57696", "HeidelB\u00c4R Games:38505", "Hobby Japan:1391", "IELLO:8923", "Kaissa Chess & Games:6214", "Lautapelit.fi:3218", "Lex Games:25203", "Lord of Boards:46500", "MINDOK:7992", "More Fun Co., Ltd.:22973", "One Moment Games:30552", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466", "Spilbr\u00e6t.dk:44204", "White Goblin Games:4932"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/312484", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6GqH14TJJhza86BX5HCLEQ__original/img/CXqwimJPonWy1oyXEMgPN_ZVmUI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5674958.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6GqH14TJJhza86BX5HCLEQ__small/img/J8SVmGOJXZGxNjkT3xYNQU7Haxg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5674958.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zti-MXWFzBo", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-TekvqPtmU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D05-2xse8U4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShxeOy3Ybcs", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grd0PcXyXLA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv8kC8XwzuY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoFu21jGwS8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUPEFCht6GQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN-hM1p03rU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7O6OTF4KoA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKHLoGzy9ng", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlCLqUVtb0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ0N77MCf5c", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI9pXlvi94E", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7qE_YADOEo"], "min_players": 1, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 1, "max_players_rec": 4, "min_players_best": 3, "max_players_best": 3, "min_age": 12, "min_age_rec": 10.404255319148936, "min_time": 30, "max_time": 120, "category": ["Adventure:1022", "Card Game:1002", "Exploration:1020", "Fantasy:1010"], "mechanic": ["Area Movement:2046", "Contracts:2912", "Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664", "Delayed Purchase:2901", "End Game Bonuses:2875", "Hand Management:2040", "Multi-Use Cards:3099", "Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846", "Open Drafting:2041", "Resource to Move:2948", "Solo / Solitaire Game:2819", "Track Movement:2939", "Turn Order: Progressive:2828", "Worker Placement:2082"], "family": ["Components: Gems/Crystals:73592", "Components: Multi-Use Cards:65191", "Components: Official Music Soundtrack:62884", "Creatures: Monsters:5615", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena:70360", "Digital Implementations: Yucata:70354", "Game: Lost Ruins of Arnak:112522", "Islands: Fictional:79690", "Occupation: Adventurer / Explorer:69209", "Players: Games with expansions that change player count:113768", "Players: Games with Solitaire Rules:5666", "Theme: Archaeology / Paleontology:21940", "Theme: Temple:69032", "Theme: Tropical:18319", "Theme: Tropical Islands:51732"], "expansion": ["Lost Ruins of Arnak: Alicorn Promo Card:349330", "Lost Ruins of Arnak: Expedition Leaders:341254", "Lost Ruins of Arnak: Rat Promo Card:430008", "Lost Ruins of Arnak: Saxophone Promo Card:336817", "Lost Ruins of Arnak: Solo Mini Expansions:349092", "Lost Ruins of Arnak: Soothsayer's Runes Promo Card:330677", "Lost Ruins of Arnak: The Missing Expedition:382350", "Lost Ruins of Arnak: The Search for Professor Kutil:338841", "Lost Ruins of Arnak: Twisted Paths:439816"], "rank": 30, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "strategygames", "game_type_id": 5497, "name": "Strategy Game", "rank": 30, "bayes_rating": 7.904}], "num_votes": 54847, "avg_rating": 8.07926, "stddev_rating": 1.26089, "bayes_rating": 7.91064, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 2.9324, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 3.033333333333333, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 312484, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"},

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:\n\nAs the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.\nAs the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.\n\n\nFeaturing more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.\n\nYet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!", "designer": ["Corey Konieczka:6651"], "artist": ["Matt Allsopp:34719", "David Ardila:32122", "Balaskas:20067", "Tiziano Baracchi:19822", "Ryan Barger:12438", "Jorge Barrero:81542", "Cassandre Bolan:86044", "Jon Bosco:63040", "Matt Bradbury:21426", "Adam Burn:46414", "Alexandre Dainche:29808", "Christina Davis:69244", "Anthony Devine:75483", "Allen Douglas:17275", "Jose Mikhail Elloso:90475", "Tony Foti:43532", "Michele Frigo:86045", "Mariusz Gandzel:18700", "Zach Graves:21095", "Richard Hanuschek:86222", "Andrew Johanson:17704", "Jeff Lee Johnson:38000", "Jason Juta:14590", "Adam Lane:46416", "Ignacio Baz\u00e1n Lazcano:46353", "Ralph McQuarrie:13442", "Mark Molnar:44813", "Jake Murray:41638", "Ameen Naksewee:59149", "David Auden Nash:49382", "Mike Nash:19549", "Maciej Rebisz:48661", "Alexandru Sabo:49381", "Tony Shasteen:14318", "Stephen Somers:77085", "Matthew Starbuck:41678", "Nicholas Stohlman:41679", "Angela Sung:49393", "Darren Tan:69091", "Ryan Valle:68942", "Jose Vega:77254", "VIKO:90477", "Magali Villeneuve:29809", "Jacob Walker:12627", "Ben Zweifel:49280"], "publisher": ["Fantasy Flight Games:17", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043", "Asterion Press:15889", "Delta Vision Publishing:6194", "Edge Entertainment:2973", "Galakta:4617", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos:15605", "Geekach LLC:58739", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264", "Hobby World:18852", "Korea Boardgames:8291"], "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/187645", "image_url": ["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7SrPNGBKg9IIsP4UQpOi8g__original/img/GKueTbkCk2Ramf6ai8mDj-BP6cI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4325841.jpg", "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7SrPNGBKg9IIsP4UQpOi8g__small/img/gAxzddRVQiRdjZHYFUZ2xc5Jlbw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4325841.jpg"], "video_url": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTbH9nh03Ug", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAm9ffDcSEQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGNHGZbOTCg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIr5N4fLueQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z_D7JwgZ9s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXyvP4k5f3o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZh7qKzkqW0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kytDmDPYqCc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQAPqVH_Ea0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3EOHhbaZsQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkhG3rYLZ0s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0aIHN9O950", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHuj3SZ1v0I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSC3rgYWiW8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlNTjSOPSPE"], "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_players_rec": 2, "max_players_rec": 2, "min_players_best": 2, "max_players_best": 2, "min_age": 14, "min_age_rec": 12.425925925925926, "min_time": 180, "max_time": 240, "category": ["Civil War:1102", "Movies / TV / Radio theme:1064", "Science Fiction:1016", "Space Exploration:1113", "Wargame:1019"], "mechanic": ["Area Majority / Influence:2080", "Area Movement:2046", "Card Play Conflict Resolution:2857", "Contracts:2912", "Delayed Purchase:2901", "Dice Rolling:2072", "Die Icon Resolution:2856", "Events:2850", "Hand Management:2040", "Hidden Movement:2967", "Income:2902", "Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846", "Tags:3100", "Take That:2686", "Team-Based Game:2019", "Variable Player Powers:2015", "Variable Set-up:2897", "Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"], "family": ["Components: Dice with Icons:65328", "Components: Map (Interplanetary or Interstellar scale):64949", "Components: Miniatures:25158", "Components: Standees:66335", "Creatures: Aliens / Extraterrestrials:5679", "Movies: Star Wars:5602"], "expansion": ["Star Wars: Rebellion \u2013 Rise of the Empire:226840"], "rank": 10, "add_rank": [{"game_type": "thematic", "game_type_id": 5496, "name": "Thematic", "rank": 6, "bayes_rating": 8.20679}], "num_votes": 35766, "avg_rating": 8.42032, "stddev_rating": 1.36202, "bayes_rating": 8.16813, "worst_rating": 1, "best_rating": 10, "complexity": 3.75, "easiest_complexity": 1, "hardest_complexity": 5, "language_dependency": 3.9305555555555554, "lowest_language_dependency": 1, "highest_language_dependency": 5, "bgg_id": 187645, "scraped_at": "2026-01-16T17:15:34+0000"}
