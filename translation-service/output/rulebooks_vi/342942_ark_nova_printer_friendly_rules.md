INTRODUCTION 6 GOAL OF THE GAME 
In Ark Nova you plan and build a modern, scientifically 
managed zoo. You build enclosures according to the 
animals' way of life and support conservation projects to 
ensure the preservation of animal species. 
Gathering diverse animals increases the attractiveness 
of your zoo, advancing you on the Appeal track and 
generating higher revenues. Likewise, careful stewardship 
of the animals allows you to support conservation projects, 
such as breeding programs, that lead to your advancement 
on the Conservation track and corresponding bonuses. 
These two tracks progress in opposite directions - if your 
counters meet, the game ends. Whoever achieves the best 
combination of appeal and conservation has built the most 
successful zoo and wins the game. 
Association work in different zoo associations allows you 
to partner with zoos and universities around the world. 
Together, with specialists and sponsors, they will help you 
manage the various tasks needed to achieve your goals. 
Both the designer and the publisher have made every effort 
to be realistic in the implementation of this game. In rare 
cases, however, concessions have been made for the sake 
of the game mechanics. For example, the koala has the 
subclass bear, which is often used colloquially, but does not 
correspond to reality. The same applies to the enclosure 
requirements.

SETUP 
Global Setup 
(D Place the game board in the center of the table. 
Take the Break token and place it on the start 
space of the Break track that corresponds to your 
player count. 
If there are three players, place the Break token on the space 
marked&J. 
@ Shuffle the 9 Bonus tiles and place a random 
Bonus tile face up on each on each of the 4 blank 
yellow Bonus spaces on the board. Do not place 
any tiles on the two yellow spaces with icons. 
Return the remaining 5 tiles to the box. They are 
not used in the game. 
For your personal setup, each of you takes the following steps: 
@ Take a random Map A zoo map, and place it with that side 
up in front of you. Return the remaining zoo maps to the 
box. They are not used in this game. 
m 4 of the 8 zoo maps have Map A on one side. All 4 copies of Map A 
are identical and we recommend it for your first game. It allows 
you an easy entry into the game and offers generous rewards. 
The other 4 zoo maps have Map O on one side (they make up another 
identical set of 4). This map is suitable for beginners after the first game. 
On the other side of all zoo maps you will find Maps 1-8; these 
are the advanced maps. These are all different and give you an 
individual special ability. We recommend these maps once you are 
familiar with the game. When playing with these, for your personal 
setup, take 2 random zoo maps and choose 1 of the advanced 
maps. Alternatively, you could also lay out player count+ 1 
advanced zoo maps and choose 1 each in reverse order of play. In 
both cases, return any unselected maps to the box. 
If you are already familiar with the game and are playing a game 
with beginners, you can give them a small starting advantage with 
Map O and a larger starting advantage with Map A. 
@ Take one set of Action cards each, consisting of the card 
types Build, Cards, Animals, Association, and Sponsors. 
Place one card with side I up under each of the five card 
slots on your zoo map: the Animals card under the slot 
furthest to the left showing the D and the remaining 
cards randomly distributed under the other 4 slots. 
@ Shuffle the Zoo cards to create a face-down deck 
on the game board on the space marked with'-. 
Deal 6 face-down cards from the deck to the spaces 
provided on the game board (you will turn them face-
up at the end of setup). This is the display. 
@ Place the 2 organizers next to the game board 
as the general supply. 
m We recommend filling one of the organizers with the 
• 
enclosures as shown to the right. Fill the other organizer 
with the remaining tiles and tokens. Components are abound. 
Thus, pack a few standard enclosures and kiosks I pavilions

in a bag as a reserve. If you still should run out of a 
component, use a suitable substitute.

time, but make sure to keep them hidden from 
the other players. 
(D Draw 8 Zoo cards. Choose 4 of them to keep as 
hand cards and discard the remaining 4 cards to 
a face-up discard pile on the discard space on the 
board. Make sure to keep your hand cards hidden 
from the other players. 
m A face-up discard pile is easier to distinguish from the other 
card piles. This prevents you from unintentionally drawing 
the wrong card type. Of course, you can keep the discard pile 
face down, if you prefer. 
m We recommend that you choose 1-2 Sponsor cards and 
2-3 Animal cards as your first hand cards. Make sure that 
the cards do not have conditions you cannot fulfil/ early on in 
the game. If possible, choose cards with icons matching the 
Base Conservation Projects on display. Alternatively, you can 
also use suggested starting decks with game tips for the first 
moves. You can download the instructions here:

B 
GAMEPLAY 
Ark Nova does not play in formal rounds; instead, players simply take turns (in clockwise order) taking one turn at a time until 
the end of the game is triggered. In addition, there are so-called breaks in between, when the game is put on hold for an 
administration phase. During these breaks you will discard cards down to your hand limit, recall workers, and gain income, 
among other things. The break procedure is explained in detail on page 18. 
You always perform one action during your turn, which may trigger additional effects and bonuses. You perform these actions 
with the 5 Action cards displayed below your zoo map. You can expand your zoo, play Zoo cards, and draw new Zoo cards. The 
position of the Action card determines how much you can do with that action. For more details on this mechanism, see the 
chapter A Turn /The 5 Action Cards on page 8. 
Your Zoo Map 
Your zoo (1) is established in the large area in the middle 
of your zoo map. This is where you place buildings such as 
enclosures (standard or special enclosures), kiosks, pavilions, 
or unique buildings. An overview of all enclosures shows 
their sizes and shapes (2). 
You are not allowed to build on the rock (R) and water (W) 
spaces, but some animals need an enclosure next to a rock or 
water space. All other spaces are building spaces, meaning 
you can place buildings on them. A space that has been built 
on is referred to as covered in game terminology. You are not 
allowed to build on spaces with the icon £.~ until you have 
upgraded your Build action card (see A Turn I The 5 Action 
Cards on page 8 for more information). 
Some spaces show a placement bonus Q (3). You receive 
the bonus indicated by the icon immediately when you cover 
it. The Icon overview explains all bonuses. 
The left edge of your zoo map has bonus spaces that can be 
activated by supporting various conservation projects (4). At 
the beginning of the game these spaces hold 7 player tokens. 
Whenever you support a conservation project, you take 
one of these player tokens and place it on the Conservation 
Project card. This always gains you an immediate bonus and 
sometimes you gain that bonus again in each break. 
The bottom of your zoo map has card slots to hold your 
Action cards (5). The number above each slot shows the 
strength of the Action card in that slot. 
On the more advanced zoo maps you will find a special 
ability that distinguishes your zoo from all others (6). Map 
A, which we recommend for your first game, has the same 
special ability for all players. At the beginning of the game, 
place a 3-space enclosure on the indicated spaces, with the 
side showing the number 3 (the empty side) up. 
(j) 
Zoo Cards 
The most important components in Ark Nova are the 3 different types of Zoo cards. The individual card types will be explained 
in detail later. 
Animal cards 
are used to 
add animals to 
your zoo. They 
require an empty 
enclosure and 
provide your 
zoo with appeal 
points. 
Sponsor cards 
allow you to hire 
specialists, build 
unique buildings, 
or achieve various 
other effects, 
among other 
things. 
w. 
The Break Track ,..... 
With Conservation Project cards you 
support conservation projects to 
collect conservation points. Usually, 
you specialize in specific animal 
species and the continents from which 
they originate. In some conservation 
projects, you are going to reintroduce 
animals into the wild. In addition to the 
Zoo cards for conservation projects, 
there are also Base Conservation 
Project cards that are available at 
the start of the game. 
The game board has a Break track to count down the time remaining until the next break. 
At the beginning of the game, and after each break, the 
Break token goes on the starting space corresponding to 
your player count (1 ). Whenever you advance the Break 
token, move it the appropriate number of spaces towards 
the end of the Break track. When you reach the last space 
of the track (2), you call a break for everyone (see page 18) . 
The break takes place after the end of your current turn. 
You get 1 X-token for reaching the last space of the Break 
track. Ignore any additional steps on the track (i.e. stop 
here). After the break, place the Break token back on the 
starting space of the track. 
...............................................................
~ ~ 
i ~ ~ ~ ~ M i M ~ i ~ 
Ha.riL«u.tM5. 
The right side of your zoo map has spaces for partner zoos (7) and universities (8), 
of which there are 5 and 3 different ones respectively. Note that there are partner 
zoos on all 5 continents, but you can only establish partnerships with a maximum of 
4 of them. Whenever you establish a new partnership with a zoo or a university, place 
the tile on the lowest empty space of the appropriate column. To get a third partner 
zoo, you must first upgrade your Association action card (see A Turn /The 5 Action 
Cards on page 8 for more information). The different background color and the [@I 
icon serve as reminders. If there is a bonus depicted on the space where you place 
your partner zoo or university, you immediately receive that bonus. 
& 
®, 
A partner zoo makes it easier for you to accommodate an animal 
from that continent in your zoo, because the cost to do so is 
reduced by 3 money per continent icon on the Animal card. 
A university grants you the bonuses and icons it shows. 
To the right are the supply spaces for your additional 
association workers (9), which you place here at 
the beginning of the game. Just like with partner 
zoos and universities, you use them from 
the bottom to the top, except that rather 
than placing tiles, you remove workers. 
Whenever you are allowed to hire an 
association worker, you take one from 
here and place it on the notepad above as an 
active worker. Certain zoo maps reward you with 
conservation points for hiring your last worker. 
All of your available association workers, money, and 
X-tokens are kept on the notepad (1 O) space above. 
A Turn / The 5 Action Cards 
Your Action cards are located below your zoo map. Each 
card is always assigned to a card slot at the bottom of the 
map. The number on the card slot indicates the strength El 
with which you can use the Action card located there. The 
numbers range from 1 on the far left to 5 on the far right, 
meaning the further to the right your Action card is when you 
perform the action, the more powerful the action will be. 
On your turn, choose one of your Action cards to perform its 
action, shift it to be lower than the others in the row, then 
perform the action of that card with a strength of El. 
After 
completing the action, remove the chosen Action card from 
its slot, shift all Action cards to the left of the newly empty 
slot to the right, and place the chosen Action card in the 
now-empty slot D-
You may use X-tokens. 
to increase the strength of an 
action. For each X-token you use, increase the strength El of 
the action by 1. Then return the token to the general supply. 
You can use as many X-tokens as you like in one action. 
With some actions, however, a strength greater than Eno 
longer improves the action. You can never have more than 
5 X-tokens. You set the strength of an action before you 
perform it. This means you can't use X-tokens gained while 
performing the action to increase the strength of this action. 
Some Zoo cards allow you to execute an effect "after 
finishing"your action. In this case, complete your action, 
including moving the Action cards, before executing the 
effect. 
At the beginning of the game, all your Action cards are 
displayed on side I. If you receive a card upgrade~' 
you 
may flip an Action card of your choice from side I to l1mlJI. 
The card remains in its current card slot. Starting with your 
next action, you can then use that Action card to perform an 
improved version of the action for the rest of the game. 
II 
There are 4 ways to upgrade one of your Action cards 
in the game: on the Conservation track, the Reputation 
track, and when you gain your second partner zoo or your 
second partner university. One of them allows you to choose 
an alternative. So be aware that you cannot upgrade all of 
your Action cards! In each game you will have to decide which 
upgrades are most important to you. 
You may not"do nothing"with your action (e.g. play O Animal 
cards or build O buildings). 
The individual actions are explained in detail on the following 
pages. Here is a short overview of the actions: 
CARDS Action (page 9) 
The Cards action allows you to gain new Zoo cards (Animals, 
Sponsor, and Conservation Project cards) from the deck or 
the display. 
BUILD Action (page 1 O) 
Enclosures are needed to accommodate animals in your zoo. 
The Build action allows you to build standard enclosures for 
animals of all categories or special enclosures for particular 
animal categories. You can build kiosks and pavilions as well. 
Example: Perform an action 
For your action this turn, you choose the Build action in card slot 
4. Shift the card down, to indicate it is being used, and perform the 
action with a strength of 4. Then, take the Action card into your 
hand, move the Action cards in slots 1-3 one slot to the right and 
place the Build Action card into the now available card slot 1. 
after your action 
at the end of your turn 
ANIMALS Action (page 11-13) 
With the Animals action you can add animals to empty 
enclosures. You need to fulfill special conditions for this and 
pay the cost for the animal acquisition. In return, animals give 
you special abilities and add icons to your zoo, which you 
might need to support conservation projects. 
ASSOCIATION Action (page 14-16) 
With the Association action, you send your association 
workers to work in zoological associations. With their help, 
your reputation increases, you can gain universities and zoos 
from other continents as partners, support conservation 
projects, or donate to animal conservation. 
SPONSORS Action (page 17) 
The Sponsors action gains you the support of sponsors (by 
playing them into your zoo). They either support you directly 
or fund a project, such as a unique building. Many of them 
gain you an ongoing effect or income. At the end of the 
game, you can gain additional appeal or conservation points 
from your sponsors. 
X-TOKEN Action (page 18) 
If you find yourself in a situation in which you can't or don't 
want to perform any of the 5 actions, you may perform this 
alternative action to gain exactly 1 X-token. You must still 
select and move a card to slot 1, shifting all other cards to the 
right like in other actions. The strength of the slot the card is 
in does not contribute to this action. 
CARDS 
Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw 
cards from the deck OR snap. 
DRAWING FROM THE DECK 
Compare the strength El of the action with the table on the 
card. Draw the indicated number of cards (maximum 3) from 
the deck. Then, you might have to discard a card from your 
hand, which can be one of the cards you have just drawn or a 
card already in your hand. 
SNAPPING 
If you execute the action with a strength El of at least D 
then instead of drawing several cards from the deck, you 
may take exactly 1 card from the display into your hand. This 
is called Snapping. You may take any card, regardless of the 
reputation of your zoo. Replenish the display at the end of 
your turn. 
ft, 
Whether you snap or draw from the deck, first advance 
a' 
the Break token 2 steps (do not gain any money for this). 
You can have any number of cards in your hand after this 
action, but during the break, you may need to discard cards 
down to your hand card limit of 3 cards (or 5 with a specific 
university) (see Break on page 18). 
R
Advance the Break ~~=~:spaces. 
Then draw 
cards from the deck or within reputation range 
OR snap. 
DRAWING WITHIN REPUTATION RANGE 
If you have upgraded the Cards action, you may draw cards 
within your reputation range, meaning from the display 
(up to your Reputation counter) and/or from the deck. In 
addition, the table printed on the card that determines the 
details of the action is upgraded. You may draw from the 
display and the deck in any order you choose, but the display 
is not replenished until you have completed your turn. 
If you have upgraded the Cards action, you can snap at a 
lower strength level, starting from a strength of 
IJ. If you choose the snap option, 
it makes no difference whether 
the strength is IJ or higher. 
In addition, after 
upgrading your 
Cards action, 
you may continue 
progressing past 9 reputation on the Reputation track . 
.....-. The Reputation Track and the Display ...., 
The game board has a display of 6 cards (see Bin the example: 
Taking cards using side II below). Next to these cards is the 
Reputation track, where you keep track of the reputation of your 
zoo (see A in the example: Taking cards using side II below). 
Whenever you are allowed to increase the reputation of your zoo 
♦, advance your counter 1 step on this track. To increase the 
reputation of your zoo to 10 (or more), you must have upgraded 
the Cards Action card to l!IIJI. 
The (IJ:-. icon on space 10 
(folder 5) serves as a reminder. 
The location of your counter determines which cards in the 
display are "within reputation range"for you. Within reputation 
range is the card on the same folder as your counter as well as 
all cards on the lower-numbered folders. This means that the 
higher your zoo's reputation, the more cards there are within your 
reputation range 
If you have taken one or more cards from the display, do not 
replenish the display until you have completed your entire 
turn. Then, move cards from the higher-numbered folders down 
to the lower-numbered folders. Do not change the order of the 
cards. Finally, fill each empty space with a card from the deck. 
Next to the display is the discard pile. You may not look through 
the discard pile during the game. 
If you advance your Reputation counter to a space with a bonus 
next to it, you take the bonus immediately and only once. If 
your counter has reached space 15 on the Reputation track and 
your zoo keeps receiving reputation, your counter will remain 
on space 15 and you instead take 1 appeal for each remaining 
j 
reputation step you are due. -------
Example: Taking cards using m" 11 
You are blue, and you are performing the action with strength 5, 
which lets you take 4 cards and discard 1. Above all, you would like 
to have the Lion that is within your reputation range in the display. 
You take the Lion (1 ), draw 2 cards from the deck (2) and then decide 
to also take the Caracal from the display (3). Then you discard a card 
from your hand. 
At the end of your action, the cards on folders 3, 5, and 6 move down 
(4) and you flip over 2 new cards for folders 5 and 6 (5). If the Lion had 
not been within reputation range, you would only have been able to 
obtain it by snapping. In that case, you would not have been allowed 
to draw any more cards, but you could have completed the action 
with strength 3 or 4. 
10 
BUILD 
51 
I 
Build exactly 1 building of your choice with 
a maximum size of l3 on your zoo map. Pay 
2 money per space. Available: Kiosk, pavilion, 
standard enclosure, and Petting Zoo. 
The size of a building is measured by the number of spaces 
it covers on your zoo map. In this action, you have the kiosk 
(size 1 ), pavilion (size 1 ), various standard enclosures (sizes 
1-5), and the Petting Zoo (special enclosure size 3) at your 
disposal. Each zoo can contain only 1 Petting Zoo. Other 
buildings can be built more than once. Your zoo map shows 
an overview of all the buildings. All standard enclosures of 
each size and all of the different special enclosures have the 
same shape. 
You need enclosures to accommodate animals, while kiosks 
grant you income during every break. Each pavilion you 
build immediately (and only once) increases the appeal of 
your zoo by 1. 
Pay the building cost into the general supply before placing 
the building on your zoo map. The cost of a building is twice 
the number of spaces it will cover, called the size. Therefore, 
cost= size x2 money. 
Build the building adjacent to an existing one, meaning at 
least 1 edge of the new building must touch an edge of an 
existing one. For your first building, instead, at least 1 space 
of it must be on a border space of your zoo map. 
You may only build on the empty spaces of your zoo map. 
Buildings may not extend beyond the edge of the map, 
overlap other buildings, or cover water or rock spaces. 
You are not allowed to build on spaces with the i..Cti 
icon yet. 
To do so, you must first upgrade your Build action card. 
A kiosk must always be at least 3 spaces from every other 
kiosk on your zoo map, meaning there must always be at 
least 2 spaces between 2 kiosks. The note below the partner 
zoo space on your zoo map serves as a reminder. 
If you cannot build the desired building on your zoo map 
according to the rules above, you must choose a different 
building. 
Build a standard enclosure with the empty side face-up so 
that it can still be occupied by an animal later. The empty side 
has a yellow edge and shows O, where X is the enclosure 
size. For the Petting Zoo both sides are the same. 
If you cover one or more spaces with a Q, you immediately 
take the corresponding placement bonus once. 
The bonuses are explained on the Icon overview.

with a maximum total size of t,;,t on your zoo 
map. Newly available: Large Bird Aviary and 
Reptile House. 
If you have upgraded the Build action, you may also build 
the special enclosures Large Bird Aviary and Reptile House 
(both size 5). Just like with the Petting Zoo, each zoo can only 
accommodate 1 Reptile House and 1 Large Bird Aviary. Both 
sides of these special enclosures are also the same. 
When you build the Reptile House or Large Bird Aviary, you 
may immediately move animals from a standard enclosure 
to the new special enclosure. You are not allowed to do this 
at any other time in the game. Please refer to the Animals 
action and page 12 specifically for more details on how 
special enclosures work. 
You cannot build unique buildings with this action, they 
only come into play with the associated Sponsor cards. 
In addition, you now have the opportunity to build several 
buildings with one action. However, you may not build 
2 identical buildings with the same Build action, each of them 
must be different. The total size of these buildings must not 
exceed l3. 
Build the buildings on your map one after the other. Pay 
for each building separately before you build it. If you cover 
a bonus icon, you immediately take the placement bonus 
before you build the next building. However, do not take any 
"after finishing" bonuses until the Build action is completed. 
Upgrading your Build action also allows you to build on the 
spaces of your zoo map with the i..(;j icon, meaning you can 
now completely cover your zoo map. If you cover every space 
of your zoo map, immediately increase the appeal of your 
zoo by 7. This can happen through the Build action, but also 
through another effect when something is built in your zoo. 
You must have covered every space on your zoo map, except 
for the water spaces and rock spaces. 
Example: Building with a placement bonus 
You are taking the Build action in card slot 5 and want to build a 
2-space and a 3-space standard enclosure. However, you only have 
7 money at your disposal and the two enclosures cost a total of 10. 
Since you are building your first enclosure on a placement bonus 
of 5 money (1 ), you take this bonus immediately after building the 
first enclosure. The money then becomes available to pay for your 
second enclosure (2). 
ANIMALS 
Play Animal cards from your hand. 
Compare the strength 13 
of the action with the table on the 
card. Play up to the indicated number of Animal cards from 
your hand. 
Follow the steps below for each animal: 
1. Check conditions: Any conditions you must fulfill in 
order to play the Animal card are indicated on the left 
side of the card. You can only play the card if you fulfill 
all the conditions (for example, a specific partner zoo 
or animal category as well as continent icons). 
The conditions are explained in the Icon overview. 
2. Pay cost: Pay the cost of the animal indicated in the 
upper-left corner of the Animal card. If you have a partner 
zoo on the continent from which the animal originates, 
this reduces the cost by 3 money per continent icon on 
the Animal card. Pay the money into the general supply. 
If you have a card that gains you money for playing the 
animal, you only take that money in a later step, meaning 
you must already have enough money beforehand to pay 
the full cost of the animal. 
3. Fill empty enclosure: To play an Animal card and 
accommodate the animal in your zoo, you need free 
spaces in an enclosure. You can place any animal, except 
Petting Zoo animals@, on its own into an empty 
standard enclosure. The enclosure must be at least the 
required size indicated in the upper-left corner of the 
Animal card. Then flip the enclosure over to its occupied 
side. Some animals also state that their enclosure needs 
to be next to one or two water and/or rock spaces. 
The enclosure requirements of an animal are indicated 
next to the size of the standard enclosure on the card. 
Petting Zoo animals cannot be accommodated in a 
standard enclosure, only in their special enclosure, 
the Petting Zoo. All reptiles and some birds can be 
accommodated either in a standard or in a special 
enclosure, the Reptile House and the Large Bird Aviary, 
respectively. In that case the card shows two different 
enclosure requirements, and you can choose whether 
to put the animal in a standard or special enclosure 
(for more details see Special Enclosures on page 12). 
4. Place Animal card: Place the Animal card next to your 
zoo map (see Placing Cards on page 13). 
5. Execute effects: Whenever you play an animal, the 
appeal of your zoo increases. Advance your counter on 
the Appeal track the number of steps indicated on the 
card. Some animals also give you conservation points or 
increase the reputation of your zoo. If so, also advance 
the counters on the corresponding tracks. Many animals 
have an additional effect when they are played. 
If the effect text contains "after finishing'; do not execute 
it until you have finished your entire Animals action. In all 
other cases, execute the effect immediately, even before 
playing another Animal card. The same applies to effects 
from other cards that are triggered by playing your 
Animal card. If there are multiple simultaneous effects, 
you choose the order of execution (whether these effects 
are appeal, reputation, conservation points, or gained by 
the ability of the animal or from other cards). 
II If your group doesn't like the interactive effects Q, you 
can instead use the alternate effects intended for the solo 
game (see Animal Card Layout on this page). 
If an action allows you to play 2 Animal cards, play them one 
after the other and complete all of the above steps for the 
first animal (except for effects with "after finishing") before 
doing the same again for the second animal. You may choose 
not to play a second Animal card. 
Only after that, and after you have moved the Animals Action 
card to slot 1 of your zoo map, execute the "after finishing" 
effects. If there are multiple effects of this type, you choose 
the order of execution. 
...... Animal Card Layout ,..... 
Animal cards represent the different animals you 
can accommodate in your zoo. 
(1) The upper-left corner explains the 
enclosure requirements you need to fulfil I. 
The number in the hexagon indicates the 
minimum size enclosure this animal may 
be placed in. (2) Next to it may appear 
1 or 2 rock and/or water icons. This means 
that the enclosure must be next to at least 
that many spaces of the depicted type(s). 
(3) If the animal can also go in a special 
enclosure, that type, and the spaces the 
animal occupies, are depicted just to the 
right of the normal enclosure requirements. 
The water and rock requirements also apply 
to the special enclosure. 
(4) Below the enclosure requirements is the 
money cost you must pay to play the card 
and accommodate the animal in your zoo.

(6) The upper-right corner shows the animal's 
category and (except for Petting Zoo animals) the 
continent from which it originates. These icons 
interact with all your other cards and are often 
important for completing conservation projects. 
(7) The lower-right corner shows the increase 
in your zoo's appeal after the animal has been 
accommodated. Some animals offer additional 
bonuses such as conservation points or reputation. 
(8) Many animals have an effect when played that 
is either executed immediately or following the 
Animals action (see Animal Abilities on Glossary 
pages 2-3.) If the Animal card's effect refers to an 
icon that appears on the card itself, that icon counts 
for the effect. 
Some Animal cards have an interactive 
effect Q e. g. Venom. This effect can only ~ 
apply to you if your zoo has 5 or more 
'6' 
appeal. The 5 space on the Appeal track 
•• • •• 
is marked as a reminder. See the Glossary 
for the effect details. 
(9) Some animals have a different effect in solo 
play, which is shown in a blue box with the .I. icon. 
...... Special Enclosures [Petting Zoo, Reptile House, Large Bird Aviary) ....-. 
There are 3 different special enclosures: Petting Zoo (1 ), Reptile 
House (2), and Large Bird Aviary (3). Your zoo can only have one 
of each type of special enclosure. 
Petting Zoo animals~ 
cannot be accommodated in a 
standard enclosure; only in their special enclosure, the Petting 
Zoo. 
All reptiles and some birds can be accommodated either in a 
standard or in a special enclosure, the Reptile House and the 
Large Bird Aviary, respectively. In that case the card shows two 
different enclosure requirements, and you can choose whether 
to put the animal in a standard or special enclosure. If an 
animal requires water and/or rock spaces next to its standard 
enclosure, the same requirement also applies to the respective 
special enclosure. 
Example: Playing animals (enclosures) 
You play the Broad-snouted Cai man 
and have 2 options to accommodate 
it in your zoo. You could put it in your 
5-space standard enclosure, since this is 
at least size 4 and next to a water space. 
Then you would flip the enclosure to its 
occupied side. But you would prefer to 
put the caiman into your Reptile House. 
This is also possible because it is next to 
water and has space for at least 2 of your 
player tokens. Place 2 of your tokens on 
the Reptile House. The 5-space enclosure 
is still available for another animal, such 
as a large non-reptilian. 
Snapping 1 
Gain any 1 card from the display. 
Example: Playing animals (immediate effect) 
If you want to accommodate the animal in a special enclosure, 
use player tokens from your supply to mark the number of 
enclosure spaces indicated in the special enclosure icon on 
the card. If there are not enough free spaces left in the special 
enclosure, you cannot accommodate the animal there. You 
never need to flip a special enclosure: Both sides of the tile are 
the same. 
If you build a Reptile House or a Large Bird Aviary and you 
already have animals in your zoo that could be accommodated 
there, you may immediately and only this once, move these 
animals into your corresponding new special enclosure. 
For each animal you move, find the smallest occupied standard 
enclosure that meets all of the animal's enclosure requirements 
(including water and rock spaces), and flip it back to its empty 
side. In the rare case there is no such enclosure, flip the smallest 
occupied standard enclosure that meets at least the animal's 
enclosure size requirement. Then mark the special enclosure 
with the corresponding number of player tokens. 
If you have several animals that could potentially be moved, 
you may decide for each animal separately whether you want 
to move it or not. 
You perform the Animals action with strength 5 to play 2 animals. First, you play the 
Eurasian Eagle-Owl (1 ). You pay the cost, flip over a 2-space enclosure (2), 
gain 4 appeal, and execute the card's effect, putting 2 new cards into your hand (3). 
Fortunately, the Eurasian Lynx is among them, which you prefer to play over the 
Marabou. Therefore, you decide to play the Eurasian Lynx as your second animal (4). 
Play Animal cards from your hand or within 
reputation range. 
Placing Cards 
If you have upgraded the Animals action, you may play 
animal cards directly from the display, instead of only from 
your hand. To do so, the respective card must be within 
your reputation range. In addition to the cost of the animal, 
you must pay an amount of money equal to the number on 
the folder from which you play the Animal card. If you are 
allowed to play 2 Animal cards, you may choose to play 2 
cards from your hand, 2 from the display, or 1 card from your 
hand and 1 card from the display. Play the animals one after 
the other. Do not replenish the display until you have finished 
In addition, you may increase the reputation of your zoo by 1, 
if you perform this action with a strength of at least I). 
Increase the reputation at the very beginning of your action, 
so that your reputation range for this action is already higher. 
Finally, after upgrading your Animals action, you may also 
play animals that have the [{I icon as a condition. 
Animal categories 
Place your played Sponsor 
and Animal cards overlapping 
each other to save space. All 
information you need for the rest 
of the game is shown at the top 
of the card. 
Some Sponsor cards have an 
additional effect at the end 
of the game. These cards are 
marked with a vertical brown 
strip behind the card level (such 
as on the 2nd card played in this 
example). This makes cards with 
endgame effects easier to find 
once they have been played. 
There are 7 animal categories 
in Ark Nova: 
()Bird 
2 of these 7 categories are special cases, bear• 
and Petting Zoo 
animal .ji.. Thus, in contrast to the other categories, their icon is 
black on a white background. 
QHerbivore 
QPredator 
()Primate 
f}Reptile 
Bear 
.ji. Petting Zoo animal 
The bears• 
are more of a subcategory. Their icon mostly occurs 
in combination with the herbivore Q or predator Q icon. 
For gameplay reasons, we invented a separate category for 
Petting Zoo animals .ji., replacing the biological category. 
If the game asks for animal categories, this implicitly includes 
bear and Petting Zoo animals as well. If this is ever not the case, 
they are explicitly excluded. 
Example: Playing animals using lfflrj11 
Constriction 
Each player ahead of you on a track 
gains 1 Constriction token for each of 
those tracks ( 0 and ([)).

You are red, and you use the upgraded Animals action to play 2 animals. 
Because you are performing the action with strength 5, you may first 
increase the reputation of your zoo by 1 to a reputation of 4 (1 ). This 
means that folders 1-3 are now within reputation range for you. 
You play the European badger from folder 3 of the display (2) and 
therefore pay 3 money in addition to the normal cost of the animal. 
Then you play another animal from your hand, the Crested Porcupine 
(3). After you have populated the respective enclosures, increased the 
appeal of your zoo, and used the abilities of the animals, your turn 
ends. Before the next player takes their turn, you replenish the display.

ASSOCIATION 
Perform exactly one association task. 
To carry out an association task, you need at least 1 active 
association worker on the notepad of your zoo map. Place 
this worker on the Association board on the task you want 
to perform. If 1 of your association workers is already on this 
task, you must instead place 2 to perform this task. If 3 of 
your association workers are already on this task, you cannot 
perform it again for the time being. Association workers in 
colors other than your own do not matter here. 
In a break, all your association workers return to your zoo 
map and become active again. As a result, all the tasks again 
become available to perform with 1 association worker. More 
about this in Break on page 18. 
Each task requires a different action strength £1. You can 
only perform an association task if your action's strength is at 
least as high as the task's value. 
The various tasks are: 
E'I Increasing reputation: Increase the reputation of 
g 
your zoo by 2. Advance your Reputation counter 
on the Reputation track and receive any bonus shown, if 
applicable. 
The reputation of your zoo determines how many cards you 
can access in the display (reputation range). In addition, 
a certain minimum reputation is required to play certain 
Sponsor cards (see Sponsors action page 17). 
IJ 
Gaining a partner zoo: Take a partner zoo from the 
Association board and place it on the lowest empty 
partner zoo space on your zoo map. If that space shows 
a bonus, take it once and immediately. You cannot take a 
partner zoo that you already have, all your partner zoos must 
be from different continents. Also, you may take a maximum 
of 4 partner zoos in total; your zoo map does not have space 
for a 5th. To take a third (or fourth) partner zoo, you must 
have upgraded the Association action to llmlll-
If you 
already have all the partner zoos that are on the Association 
board at that moment, or if you cannot place the partner 
zoo on your zoo map, you cannot perform this task. In the 
break, the supply of partner zoos on the Association board is 
replenished (see Break page 18). 
Each partner zoo reduces the cost of playing all Animal cards 
from its continent by 3 money per continent icon on the 
Animal card. It also provides you 1 icon of the respective 
continent, which may trigger other card effects and may 
count towards conservation projects. Certain Animal cards 
require a partner zoo from the same continent. 
:1'11 
Gaining a partner university:Take a university 
Ii.I 
from the Association board and place it on the 
lowest available university space of your zoo map. If that 
space shows a bonus, take it once and immediately. You 
also advance your Reputation counter accordingly if this is 
depicted on the university. You cannot take a university you 
already have. So, if you already have all the universities that 
are on the Association board at that moment, you cannot 
perform this task. In the break, the supply of universities on 
the Association board is replenished (see Break page 18). 
Universities increase the reputation of your zoo, grant 
research icons, and are the only way to increase your hand 
limit to 5 cards . 
....,.., The Association Board 
The Association board is divided into 2 areas. In the blue area are the tasks that you can perform using your association workers. 
If you have not upgraded the Association action, you can only perform exactly 1 of these tasks. In the pink area, after upgrading 
your Association action card, you can gain additional conservation points by donating to animal conservation organizations. 
Above and below the Association board are the spaces for the conservation projects that you can support during the game.

:1:1 Conservation project work: You may either support 
1:.1 a conservation project already in play or play a 
Conservation Project card from your hand and support 
it immediately. If you bring a new Conservation Project 
card into play, place it above the Association board on the 
leftmost space. If there is already a conservation project 
there, move all the Conservation Project cards above 
the board one place to the right before placing the card. 
Depending on your player count, there can only be up to 
2, 3 or 4 cards above the Association board. If (after placing 
the new conservation project) there are more cards above 
the board than is allowed for your player count, put the 
rightmost card on the discard pile. Return any player tokens 
on the discarded card to the supply (not to the zoo map) of 
the corresponding player. The base conservation projects 
below the Association board are never moved even when 
they are fully supported. Also no new base conservation 
projects are added during the game. 
To support a conservation project, you must fulfill a condition 
(depicted on the card) that has no player token on it. You are 
only allowed to support each conservation project once. This 
means you cannot support a project that already has one of 
your player tokens on it. 
Place 1 player token of your choice from the left side of 
your zoo map on the condition you fulfill, and as a reward 
advance your Conservation counter and Reputation counter 
(if applicable) as per the depicted award on the card. If you 
can fulfil I more than one condition, you choose which one. 
An explanation of the various conservation projects is in the 
Glossary on page 1. 
When you take the player token from your zoo map, you 
activate the corresponding bonus. You always gain the bonus 
immediately. With some of them, you also gain the bonus 
again during each break. Choose whether you take this 
bonus before or after the reward for the conservation project. 
The bonuses are explained in the Icon overview. 
m Tip: It is sometimes worthwhile to support a conservation project 
on a lower level, for example in order to get the bonuses on the 
Conservation track or to activate an income on the left side of 
your zoo map early in the game. 
Example: Playing a Conservation Project card 
You play a new Conservation Project card from 
your hand: Large Animals. Since there are 
three players and 3 conservation projects are 
already out, you must first discard the rightmost 
Conservation Project card (Reptile Breeding 
Program) (1 ), move the other two project 
cards one position to the right (2), and then 
place the new Large Animals card in the newly 
available space on the left (3). Since you have 
3 large animals in your zoo, take a player token 
from your zoo map and place it on the middle 
condition (4). For this you gain 3 conservation 
points. You also get the bonus on the space from 
which you took your player token, which was to 
immediately (and only once) take 3 X-tokens. 
....., Conservation Projects Layouts ,.,.... 
These cards represent the different conservation projects you 
can support. Each card depicts 3 conditions (1) to fulfil I, as well 
as the corresponding rewards (2). Certain Conservation Project 
cards grant an additional bonus to the player who plays them 
(3). There are two types of conservation projects. 
Requires reptile icons 
In most cases, you must have a 
certain number of a specific icon 
in your zoo (in the example to 
the left, Reptiles). Count the icons 
on the top edge of all your cards, 
both on Animal and Sponsor cards 
(including the water or rock space 
requirements, but not including 
the conditions on the left) as 
well as on your partner zoos and 
universities. 
Conservation projects in which 
you release an animal into the 
wild work slightly differently. 
Instead of collecting a number of 
icons, you must discard 1 Animal 
card with a specific icon from 
your zoo (in this case, Africa A). 
You choose the matching animal 
to discard but the animal must 
require a standard enclosure of 
the depicted size (B).Whether 
the animal can also be placed in 
a special enclosure is irrelevant to 
the condition. Move your Appeal 
counter back as many steps as indicated on the Animal card. 
Remove the appropriate number of player tokens from your 
special enclosure (if you can) OR flip the smallest occupied 
standard enclosure that meets the animal's requirements from 
the occupied side to the empty side. Place the Animal card on 
the discard pile. See Glossary page 1 for details to Release into 
\, the Wild conservation projects.

Example: Releasing an animal 
You decide to release your African Spurred Tortoise into the 
Serengeti National Park. The tortoise needs a 3-space enclosure 
and thus fulnlls the middle condition, which is still unclaimed. You 
decide to mark the remaining space on the Conservation Project 
card with your player token from the "12 money" space (1 ). 
As the animal leaves your zoo, you remove 
2 player tokens from your Reptile House 
and take them back into your supply. You 
move your counter on the Appeal track 
back 6 steps (the animal's appeal). The 
other information on the card doesn't 
matter. Then you advance your counter on 
the Conservation track 4 steps and take 
12 money (since you took the player token 
from the corresponding bonus space). 
Finally, you place the African Spurred 
Tortoise card on the discard pile (2).

Example: Association tasks with {ffirj11 
You decide to spend an X-token for the Association action in card 
slot 5 to execute it with strength 6. You gain one university and 
2 reputation with one association worker each (1 ). In addition, 
you pay 5 money as a donation and gain one conservation point 
for it (2). The next donation will cost 7 money. 
Perform one or more different association 
tasks. You may make one donation. 
If you have upgraded the Association action, you may 
perform several different association tasks with one action. 
For each task, you need 1 or 2 of your association workers. 
The total value of all association tasks may not exceed the 
strength l3 of your action. The total value may be less. 
If you select to perform conservation project work and 
support a new Conservation Project card, you may play that 
card directly from the display. The card you play must be 
within your reputation range. As an additional cost, you must 
pay an amount of money equal to the number on the folder 
from which you play the Conservation Project card. Do not 
replenish the display until you have completed your turn. 
In addition to the association tasks, you are allowed to make 
exactly 1 donation to an animal welfare program. Pay the 
smallest amount of money visible in the "donation" area (I!]) 
into the general supply and then cover the corresponding 
space with one of your player tokens from your supply so 
that the amount of money on this space is no longer visible. 
You gain 1 conservation point for this. If all spaces but the 
last one are occupied by player tokens, each subsequent 
donation costs 12 money, and you do not have to place any 
more tokens on that space. 
To be able to make a donation, you must have performed 
at least 1 association task during the same action. You do 
not need an association worker to make a donation. You can 
make a maximum of 1 donation per Association action. 
SPONSORS 
Play exactly 1 Sponsor card OR advance the 
Break token and take money. 
This action allows you to play exactly ~onsor 
card from 
your hand, provided that the strength U of the action is at 
least equal to the level of the Sponsor card and you meet any 
conditions on the card (depicted on the left side of the card). 
Execute the instant effect (if available) and/or the recurring 
effect of the card (if available and triggered by the icon on 
this Sponsor card), then place it next to your zoo map.

Play one or more Sponsor cards OR advance 
the Break token and take money. 
If you have upgraded the Sponsors action, you can play 
multiple Sponsor cards with one action. The strength l3 
of your action plus 1 must be at least as high as the sum of 
the levels on all played cards (remember, with the help of 
X-tokens you can also increase the l3 beyond D- Play the 
cards one after the other, meaning you completely execute 
all the instant effects of one card (except for"after finishing" 
effects) before playing the next card. 
When playing Sponsor cards, you may choose to play them 
from the display or your hand. Any cards played from 
the display must be within your reputation range. Pay an 
additional amount of money equal to the number on 
the folder from which you play the Sponsor card. Do not 
replenish the display until you have completed your turn. 
If you use the Sponsors action to advance the Break token, 
you take l3 money twice. 
Finally, after upgrading your Sponsors action, you may also 
play Sponsor cards that have the [i 
icon as a condition. 
Example: Playing a Sponsor card 
Use the Sponsors action to play the Meerkat Den 
card (see above). You need an action strength 
of 5 and the reputation of your zoo must be at 
least 3. You take the Meerkat Den from the unique 
buildings and place it on your zoo map, next to at 
least 1 rock. You can recognize the Meerkat Den 
by the icon in the lower-left corner of the card. 
Since the Meerkat Den card itself has a herbivore 
icon, the appeal of your zoo immediately 
increases by 2. 
....., Sponsor cards Layout ,,.,..,. 
(1) The level for each Sponsor card is in its upper-left corner. 
(2) If the card lets you place a special building in your zoo, 
and this building must be built next to water or rocks, this 
requirement is shown next to the level (where it would also 
be on Animal cards). (3) Any conditions that you must fulfil! in 
order to play the card are shown on the left side of the card. (4)

Place next to at least 1 rock space. 
(6) A one-off effect when playing the card is indicated by a

An effect during the final scoring is indicated by a brown 
background in the lower-right corner of the card. A vertical 
brown strip behind the card level (1) serves as a reminder that 
this card has an effect in the final scoring (in case you place the 
cards overlapping each other). 
If an effect on a Sponsor card refers to an icon that appears 
on the Sponsor card itself, this icon counts for the effect or for 
triggering the effect. However, only the icons in the upper-right 
corners of cards (4) are used, not those anywhere else on the 
card, except for the rock and water icons, which are in the upper-
I eft corner. 
(8) Some effects are already explained on the Sponsor card itself; 
\ all card effects are explained on Glossary pages 4-7.

If you cannot or do not want to perform any of the 5 actions, 
you can still use this alternative action and take 1 X-token. 
You can perform this action using any Action card. It is 
independent of the l3 value of the card's slot and you 
cannot use X-tokens to increase the strength of the action. It 
doesn't matter whether the Action card has been upgraded. 
You must still select an Action card, move it to slot 1, and shift 
the intervening cards to the right. Then, take an X-token. If 
you already have 5 X-tokens, you cannot perform this action . 
.......................... 
v .......................................... 
Appeal and Conservation Points 
During the game you increase the appeal of your zoo and 
collect conservation points. This is necessary to win and also 
helps you during the game. 
The appeal of your zoo determines how much money you 
earn in each break. 
Additionally, there are 4 spaces on the Conservation track 
that provide an immediate one-time effect when you reach 
or pass them. Those spaces are the following: 
• 2 conservation points: 
Either upgrade one of your Action cards 
(flip it over) or activate an additional 
association worker (take a lying down 
worker from the lowest space below the 
notepad and place it onto the notepad). Either option is 
available to each player who reaches space 2. 
• S I B conservation points: 
Take either 5 money or one of the 
bonus tokens next to this space on the 
Conservation track. Execute the effect 
(money or Bonus token) immediately. 
If you take a Bonus token, remove it 
from the game afterwards. The option 
to take 5 money remains even after 
both Bonus tokens are gone. 
• 1 O conservation points: 
The first time a player reaches, or exceeds, 
1 o Conservation Points, all players choose 
and discard one of their Final Scoring cards. 
Place them facedown under the 
pile of remaining Final Scoring cards. If 
no one accrues 1 O Conservation Points 
before the game ends, all players must 
choose and discard a Final Scoring card 
before end game scoring can begin. 
Break 
Ark Nova does not follow a fixed round system. You take 
turns, taking 1 turn at a time, until the Break token has 
advanced to the last space of the Break track ii •. An Action 
card, Sponsor card, or Animal card effect could cause this to 
happen. If you trigger the break, gain 1 X-token. Complete 
your current turn, take the Break token, and then all players 
perform the following steps in order: 
1. Hand card limit: 
--~ 
If you have more cards in your hand than your 
([] 1: hand limit allows, discard any surplus cards of 
(ctfsl), your choice from your hand to the discard pile. 
_'l,Ji;'..J 
__ : Normally your hand limit is 3, but a particular 
university allows you to hold 5 (\\[)). 
2. Tokens on Action cards: 
~11:\ 2 
If you have Multiplier, Venom, and/or 
W 
Constriction tokens on your Action cards, 
return them to the supply. They no longer 
have any effect. 
3. Association board: 
Return all your association workers from 
the Association board to the notepad on 
your zoo map. They become available to 
you again as active workers. Replenish the 
display of partner zoos and universities so that exactly 
one of each partner zoo and university is now available 
again.There is no need to replenish universities and 
partner zoos that all players already have. 
4. Replenish display: 
Discard the two bottom cards of the display 
(folders 1 and 2) to the discard pile, move 
the remaining cards down and replenish 
the display. The icon ii ~ 
on folders 1 
and 2 serves as a reminder. 
5. Take income: 
Most of the time, all players can take their income 
simultaneously. Some effects may require this to happen 
in player order, such as multiple players having an effect 
that allows them to take a card from the display. In 
these situations, affected players should take income in 
clockwise order starting from the player who initiated the 
Break. The display is replenished after each player. 
a. Collect income according to the appeal of your zoo. 
Take the amount of money indicated next to your 
counter on the Appeal track. 
Example: If your counter is on space 7 of the Appeal track, 
take 11 money. 
b. Collect income for the kiosks on your zoo map. Check 
each kiosk on your zoo map separately. Take 1 money 
for each unique building, special enclosure, occupied 
standard enclosure, and pavilion adjacent to it. A 
building must share at least one side of one space with 
a kiosk in order to be considered adjacent to it. An 
empty standard enclosure does not provide income 
(but an empty special enclosure does). 
c. Collect all the income indicated by the following icon: 
. The icon appears on some Sponsor cards and 
in some bonuses on the left side of your zoo map. 
Take only the bonuses on your zoo map that you 
have already activated (those you have uncovered by 
placing the player token on a conservation project). 
6. Break track: 
~! 
Return the Break token to the starting 
space for your player count. 
Then the break ends, and the game continues with the next 
player in clockwise order taking their next turn. 
END OF GAMES FINAL SCORING 
1.Gameend 
If at the end of your turn or during a break your 
Conservation counter and Appeal counter are ever 
in the same scoring area, or if they have passed one 
another, the end of the game is triggered. Each scoring 
area comprises one space of the Conservation track and 
the adjacent spaces of the Appeal track. 
If the end of the game is triggered at the end of your 
turn, all other players (but not you) will take one more 
turn. The next time it would be your turn, move on to 
final scoring instead. If the end of the game is triggered 
during a break, all players (including you) will take one 
more turn. 
2. Score cards 
At the end of the game, you still get conservation points 
or appeal from your Final Scoring card(s), as well as from 
all your cards with an end-of-game icon ~- Remember, 
if no player reached 1 O conservation points, all players 
should discard one of their Final Scoring cards before 
adding these points to their totals. 
3. Determine Victory Points 
Finally, it's time to tally Victory Points. Find the little white 
number in the space where your conservation counter 
is located. Add this number to the value of your appeal 
counter to get your Victory Points total. 
The player with the highest Victory Point total is the 
winner. In case of a tie, the tied player who supported 
the most Conservation Projects wins the game (you can 
determine this by counting how many player tokens have 
been removed from the left side of your zoo map). If the 
score is still a tie, all tied players share the victory. 
You may have noticed that in order to win the game your appeal 
counter and conservation counter have to cross one another! 
Keep that in mind as you make decisions to maximize your score! 
Example: Game end 
Red has 64 appeal and 
20 conservation points. 
Both counters are in the 
same scoring area (white 
frame). 
The game end is triggered. 
Example: Income for kiosks 
You take 4 money for your kiosks, 2 money for each of them. 
( 
Final Scoring Card Layout ,,,.,... 
Each Final Scoring card uses either a table (below, left) or text 
(below, right) to indicate how you can gain 1-4 additional 
Conservation Points at the end of the game. For scoring 
purposes, consider your universities and the cards in front 
of you and the icons on them. You can never gain more than 
4 conservation points from a single Final Scoring card. 
Gain () for Sponsor cards 
in your zoo. 
(D 1 
--
.&; Do not use. Draw another 
Example: Determine Victory Points 
(1) Blue has 16 conservation points; the little white number 
in that space is 24. Blue has 80 appeal. 
Blues total score is (24 + 80 =) 104 Victory Points . 
(3) Red has 18 conservation points; the little white number 
in that space is 30. Red has 78 appeal. 
Reds total score is (30 + 78 =) 108 Victory Points.

SOLO GAME • ....._. • • • • • • 
-.-.-• 
•-••• 
• 6 4 
I•-•~-
6 6 6 6 W 
If you play Ark Nova on your own, modify the rules as follows: 
Setup 
• Lay out 3 basic Conservation Project cards and do not place 
any tokens of a different color on them (i. e. like a 3-player 
setup). 
• Do not use the Break token. Instead, place 7 player tokens of 
any unused col or on the spaces in the left column of the big 
solo tile (A). 
• You start the game with 20 appeal. Place the little solo tile on 
space 45 of the appeal track, with the matching side up (B). 
Turn/ Cards 
Cards with interactive effects have a blue stripe at the bottom 
with the~ 
icon; the contents of the blue stripe replace the 
card's interactive effect with an appropriate solo effect. You 
will find this feature on 1 Final Scoring card and a number of 
Animal cards. 
When playing a Sponsor card with the condition "max. 25 
appeal'; treat it as saying max. 45 appeal instead. The tile on 
the appeal track reminds you of that. 
There can be up to 2 Conservation Project cards above the 
Association board. 
If you perform an action that would advance the Break token, 
it simply doesn't. If you would take money for moving it, you 
still get the money. You do not get an X-token for triggering a 
break (see Gameplay I Breaks to the right). 
Examples: You play the Cougar with the ability Jump 3. Although 
there is no Break token to advance, you still take 3 money. 
You use the upgraded Sponsors action with a strength X of 4 for 
the break ability. Although there is no Break token to advance, you 
still take 8 money. 
Gameplay / Breaks 
Every time you end a turn, move the topmost player token in 
the left column of the solo tile onto the space to its right (in 
the right column) (1 ). If you move the last token from the left 
column into the right column (2) (and thus reveal the break 
icon), you immediately resolve a break. 
At the beginning of the break, place the topmost player token 
onto the open donation space with the smallest number 
on the Association board (3) (if all the other spaces, except 
for space 12, are already occupied place it next to space 12, 
even if this has no effect on the donations) and move the 
remaining tokens back into the left column of the solo tile 
(but now 1 more row is empty). 
Then perform all steps of a break except for step 6. 
Example: Setup and Gameplay 
The game ends after 6 rounds, when only 2 tokens are left on 
the solo tile and you moved the bottom one to the right. Do 
not trigger another break, but do the final scoring instead. 
If you have at least 100 Victory Points after the final scoring 
(meaning both your Appeal counter and Conservation 
counter have reached the same scoring area or passed each 
other), you have won the solo game. 
Difficulty Levels/ Solo Challenge 
We recommend that beginners start the solo game with 
an appeal of 20. Depending on your experience, you could 
instead start the game with 1 o or even o appeal. When 
starting with 1 0 appeal, turn the little solo tile to the 35 side 
and place it on the matching space on the appeal track. Treat 
the condition "max. 25 appeal" as saying "max. 35 appeal''. 
When starting with 0 appeal, don't use the little solo tile. 
Starting the solo game with 0 appeal is quite a challenge! Feel 
free to play as many games as you like at each difficulty level. 
As a special challenge, play 3 games in a row. In this case, 
do not shuffle the cards after each game. Instead, remove all 
cards from that particular game (discard pile, display, all of 
your cards, and all of the conservation projects) and set up 
the game with the remaining cards. Also remove the two zoo 
maps you had to choose from, as well as the 4 Bonus tiles. 
For the third game, you will have to reuse a random 3 of the 
removed Bonus tiles. 
You no longer have access to the cards that are out of play, 
with the only exception being the animal abilities Assertion 
and Dominance. 
At the end of each game, record your score; then total all 
3 scores at the very end. If the sum is at least 300 you have 
passed the challenge!

INTRODUCTION 6 GOAL OF THE GAME 
In Ark Nova you plan and build a modern, scientifically 
managed zoo. You build enclosures according to the 
animals' way of life and support conservation projects to 
ensure the preservation of animal species. 
Gathering diverse animals increases the attractiveness 
of your zoo, advancing you on the Appeal track and 
generating higher revenues. Likewise, careful stewardship 
of the animals allows you to support conservation projects, 
such as breeding programs, that lead to your advancement 
on the Conservation track and corresponding bonuses. 
These two tracks progress in opposite directions - if your 
counters meet, the game ends. Whoever achieves the best 
combination of appeal and conservation has built the most 
successful zoo and wins the game. 
Association work in different zoo associations allows you 
to partner with zoos and universities around the world. 
Together, with specialists and sponsors, they will help you 
manage the various tasks needed to achieve your goals. 
Both the designer and the publisher have made every effort 
to be realistic in the implementation of this game. In rare 
cases, however, concessions have been made for the sake 
of the game mechanics. For example, the koala has the 
subclass bear, which is often used colloquially, but does not 
correspond to reality. The same applies to the enclosure 
requirements.

SETUP 
Global Setup 
(D Place the game board in the center of the table. 
Take the Break token and place it on the start 
space of the Break track that corresponds to your 
player count. 
If there are three players, place the Break token on the space 
marked&J. 
@ Shuffle the 9 Bonus tiles and place a random 
Bonus tile face up on each on each of the 4 blank 
yellow Bonus spaces on the board. Do not place 
any tiles on the two yellow spaces with icons. 
Return the remaining 5 tiles to the box. They are 
not used in the game. 
For your personal setup, each of you takes the following steps: 
@ Take a random Map A zoo map, and place it with that side 
up in front of you. Return the remaining zoo maps to the 
box. They are not used in this game. 
m 4 of the 8 zoo maps have Map A on one side. All 4 copies of Map A 
are identical and we recommend it for your first game. It allows 
you an easy entry into the game and offers generous rewards. 
The other 4 zoo maps have Map O on one side (they make up another 
identical set of 4). This map is suitable for beginners after the first game. 
On the other side of all zoo maps you will find Maps 1-8; these 
are the advanced maps. These are all different and give you an 
individual special ability. We recommend these maps once you are 
familiar with the game. When playing with these, for your personal 
setup, take 2 random zoo maps and choose 1 of the advanced 
maps. Alternatively, you could also lay out player count+ 1 
advanced zoo maps and choose 1 each in reverse order of play. In 
both cases, return any unselected maps to the box. 
If you are already familiar with the game and are playing a game 
with beginners, you can give them a small starting advantage with 
Map O and a larger starting advantage with Map A. 
@ Take one set of Action cards each, consisting of the card 
types Build, Cards, Animals, Association, and Sponsors. 
Place one card with side I up under each of the five card 
slots on your zoo map: the Animals card under the slot 
furthest to the left showing the D and the remaining 
cards randomly distributed under the other 4 slots. 
@ Shuffle the Zoo cards to create a face-down deck 
on the game board on the space marked with'-. 
Deal 6 face-down cards from the deck to the spaces 
provided on the game board (you will turn them face-
up at the end of setup). This is the display. 
@ Place the 2 organizers next to the game board 
as the general supply. 
m We recommend filling one of the organizers with the 
• 
enclosures as shown to the right. Fill the other organizer 
with the remaining tiles and tokens. Components are abound. 
Thus, pack a few standard enclosures and kiosks I pavilions

in a bag as a reserve. If you still should run out of a 
component, use a suitable substitute.

(D Draw 8 Zoo cards. Choose 4 of them to keep as 
hand cards and discard the remaining 4 cards to 
a face-up discard pile on the discard space on the 
board. Make sure to keep your hand cards hidden 
from the other players. 
m A face-up discard pile is easier to distinguish from the other 
card piles. This prevents you from unintentionally drawing 
the wrong card type. Of course, you can keep the discard pile 
face down, if you prefer. 
m We recommend that you choose 1-2 Sponsor cards and 
2-3 Animal cards as your first hand cards. Make sure that 
the cards do not have conditions you cannot fulfil/ early on in 
the game. If possible, choose cards with icons matching the 
Base Conservation Projects on display. Alternatively, you can 
also use suggested starting decks with game tips for the first 
moves. You can download the instructions here:

B 
GAMEPLAY 
Ark Nova does not play in formal rounds; instead, players simply take turns (in clockwise order) taking one turn at a time until 
the end of the game is triggered. In addition, there are so-called breaks in between, when the game is put on hold for an 
administration phase. During these breaks you will discard cards down to your hand limit, recall workers, and gain income, 
among other things. The break procedure is explained in detail on page 18. 
You always perform one action during your turn, which may trigger additional effects and bonuses. You perform these actions 
with the 5 Action cards displayed below your zoo map. You can expand your zoo, play Zoo cards, and draw new Zoo cards. The 
position of the Action card determines how much you can do with that action. For more details on this mechanism, see the 
chapter A Turn /The 5 Action Cards on page 8. 
Your Zoo Map 
Your zoo (1) is established in the large area in the middle 
of your zoo map. This is where you place buildings such as 
enclosures (standard or special enclosures), kiosks, pavilions, 
or unique buildings. An overview of all enclosures shows 
their sizes and shapes (2). 
You are not allowed to build on the rock (R) and water (W) 
spaces, but some animals need an enclosure next to a rock or 
water space. All other spaces are building spaces, meaning 
you can place buildings on them. A space that has been built 
on is referred to as covered in game terminology. You are not 
allowed to build on spaces with the icon £.~ until you have 
upgraded your Build action card (see A Turn I The 5 Action 
Cards on page 8 for more information). 
Some spaces show a placement bonus Q (3). You receive 
the bonus indicated by the icon immediately when you cover 
it. The Icon overview explains all bonuses. 
The left edge of your zoo map has bonus spaces that can be 
activated by supporting various conservation projects (4). At 
the beginning of the game these spaces hold 7 player tokens. 
Whenever you support a conservation project, you take 
one of these player tokens and place it on the Conservation 
Project card. This always gains you an immediate bonus and 
sometimes you gain that bonus again in each break. 
The bottom of your zoo map has card slots to hold your 
Action cards (5). The number above each slot shows the 
strength of the Action card in that slot. 
On the more advanced zoo maps you will find a special 
ability that distinguishes your zoo from all others (6). Map 
A, which we recommend for your first game, has the same 
special ability for all players. At the beginning of the game, 
place a 3-space enclosure on the indicated spaces, with the 
side showing the number 3 (the empty side) up. 
(j) 
Zoo Cards 
The most important components in Ark Nova are the 3 different types of Zoo cards. The individual card types will be explained 
in detail later. 
Animal cards 
are used to 
add animals to 
your zoo. They 
require an empty 
enclosure and 
provide your 
zoo with appeal 
points. 
Sponsor cards 
allow you to hire 
specialists, build 
unique buildings, 
or achieve various 
other effects, 
among other

The Break Track ,..... 
With Conservation Project cards you 
support conservation projects to 
collect conservation points. Usually, 
you specialize in specific animal 
species and the continents from which 
they originate. In some conservation 
projects, you are going to reintroduce 
animals into the wild. In addition to the 
Zoo cards for conservation projects, 
there are also Base Conservation 
Project cards that are available at 
the start of the game. 
The game board has a Break track to count down the time remaining until the next break. 
At the beginning of the game, and after each break, the 
Break token goes on the starting space corresponding to 
your player count (1 ). Whenever you advance the Break 
token, move it the appropriate number of spaces towards 
the end of the Break track. When you reach the last space 
of the track (2), you call a break for everyone (see page 18) . 
The break takes place after the end of your current turn. 
You get 1 X-token for reaching the last space of the Break 
track. Ignore any additional steps on the track (i.e. stop 
here). After the break, place the Break token back on the 
starting space of the track.

The right side of your zoo map has spaces for partner zoos (7) and universities (8), 
of which there are 5 and 3 different ones respectively. Note that there are partner 
zoos on all 5 continents, but you can only establish partnerships with a maximum of 
4 of them. Whenever you establish a new partnership with a zoo or a university, place 
the tile on the lowest empty space of the appropriate column. To get a third partner 
zoo, you must first upgrade your Association action card (see A Turn /The 5 Action 
Cards on page 8 for more information). The different background color and the [@I 
icon serve as reminders. If there is a bonus depicted on the space where you place 
your partner zoo or university, you immediately receive that bonus. 
& 
®, 
A partner zoo makes it easier for you to accommodate an animal 
from that continent in your zoo, because the cost to do so is 
reduced by 3 money per continent icon on the Animal card. 
A university grants you the bonuses and icons it shows. 
To the right are the supply spaces for your additional 
association workers (9), which you place here at 
the beginning of the game. Just like with partner 
zoos and universities, you use them from 
the bottom to the top, except that rather 
than placing tiles, you remove workers. 
Whenever you are allowed to hire an 
association worker, you take one from 
here and place it on the notepad above as an 
active worker. Certain zoo maps reward you with 
conservation points for hiring your last worker. 
All of your available association workers, money, and 
X-tokens are kept on the notepad (1 O) space above. 
A Turn / The 5 Action Cards 
Your Action cards are located below your zoo map. Each 
card is always assigned to a card slot at the bottom of the 
map. The number on the card slot indicates the strength El 
with which you can use the Action card located there. The 
numbers range from 1 on the far left to 5 on the far right, 
meaning the further to the right your Action card is when you 
perform the action, the more powerful the action will be. 
On your turn, choose one of your Action cards to perform its 
action, shift it to be lower than the others in the row, then 
perform the action of that card with a strength of El. 
After 
completing the action, remove the chosen Action card from 
its slot, shift all Action cards to the left of the newly empty 
slot to the right, and place the chosen Action card in the 
now-empty slot D-
You may use X-tokens. 
to increase the strength of an 
action. For each X-token you use, increase the strength El of 
the action by 1. Then return the token to the general supply. 
You can use as many X-tokens as you like in one action. 
With some actions, however, a strength greater than Eno 
longer improves the action. You can never have more than 
5 X-tokens. You set the strength of an action before you 
perform it. This means you can't use X-tokens gained while 
performing the action to increase the strength of this action. 
Some Zoo cards allow you to execute an effect "after 
finishing"your action. In this case, complete your action, 
including moving the Action cards, before executing the 
effect. 
At the beginning of the game, all your Action cards are 
displayed on side I. If you receive a card upgrade~' 
you 
may flip an Action card of your choice from side I to l1mlJI. 
The card remains in its current card slot. Starting with your 
next action, you can then use that Action card to perform an 
improved version of the action for the rest of the game. 
II 
There are 4 ways to upgrade one of your Action cards 
in the game: on the Conservation track, the Reputation 
track, and when you gain your second partner zoo or your 
second partner university. One of them allows you to choose 
an alternative. So be aware that you cannot upgrade all of 
your Action cards! In each game you will have to decide which 
upgrades are most important to you. 
You may not"do nothing"with your action (e.g. play O Animal 
cards or build O buildings). 
The individual actions are explained in detail on the following 
pages. Here is a short overview of the actions: 
CARDS Action (page 9) 
The Cards action allows you to gain new Zoo cards (Animals, 
Sponsor, and Conservation Project cards) from the deck or 
the display. 
BUILD Action (page 1 O) 
Enclosures are needed to accommodate animals in your zoo. 
The Build action allows you to build standard enclosures for 
animals of all categories or special enclosures for particular 
animal categories. You can build kiosks and pavilions as well. 
Example: Perform an action 
For your action this turn, you choose the Build action in card slot 
4. Shift the card down, to indicate it is being used, and perform the 
action with a strength of 4. Then, take the Action card into your 
hand, move the Action cards in slots 1-3 one slot to the right and 
place the Build Action card into the now available card slot 1. 
after your action 
at the end of your turn 
ANIMALS Action (page 11-13) 
With the Animals action you can add animals to empty 
enclosures. You need to fulfill special conditions for this and 
pay the cost for the animal acquisition. In return, animals give 
you special abilities and add icons to your zoo, which you 
might need to support conservation projects. 
ASSOCIATION Action (page 14-16) 
With the Association action, you send your association 
workers to work in zoological associations. With their help, 
your reputation increases, you can gain universities and zoos 
from other continents as partners, support conservation 
projects, or donate to animal conservation. 
SPONSORS Action (page 17) 
The Sponsors action gains you the support of sponsors (by 
playing them into your zoo). They either support you directly 
or fund a project, such as a unique building. Many of them 
gain you an ongoing effect or income. At the end of the 
game, you can gain additional appeal or conservation points 
from your sponsors. 
X-TOKEN Action (page 18) 
If you find yourself in a situation in which you can't or don't 
want to perform any of the 5 actions, you may perform this 
alternative action to gain exactly 1 X-token. You must still 
select and move a card to slot 1, shifting all other cards to the 
right like in other actions. The strength of the slot the card is 
in does not contribute to this action. 
CARDS 
Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw 
cards from the deck OR snap. 
DRAWING FROM THE DECK 
Compare the strength El of the action with the table on the 
card. Draw the indicated number of cards (maximum 3) from 
the deck. Then, you might have to discard a card from your 
hand, which can be one of the cards you have just drawn or a 
card already in your hand. 
SNAPPING 
If you execute the action with a strength El of at least D 
then instead of drawing several cards from the deck, you 
may take exactly 1 card from the display into your hand. This 
is called Snapping. You may take any card, regardless of the 
reputation of your zoo. Replenish the display at the end of 
your turn. 
ft, 
Whether you snap or draw from the deck, first advance 
a' 
the Break token 2 steps (do not gain any money for this). 
You can have any number of cards in your hand after this 
action, but during the break, you may need to discard cards 
down to your hand card limit of 3 cards (or 5 with a specific 
university) (see Break on page 18). 
R
Advance the Break ~~=~:spaces. 
Then draw 
cards from the deck or within reputation range 
OR snap. 
DRAWING WITHIN REPUTATION RANGE 
If you have upgraded the Cards action, you may draw cards 
within your reputation range, meaning from the display 
(up to your Reputation counter) and/or from the deck. In 
addition, the table printed on the card that determines the 
details of the action is upgraded. You may draw from the 
display and the deck in any order you choose, but the display 
is not replenished until you have completed your turn. 
If you have upgraded the Cards action, you can snap at a 
lower strength level, starting from a strength of 
IJ. If you choose the snap option, 
it makes no difference whether 
the strength is IJ or higher. 
In addition, after 
upgrading your 
Cards action, 
you may continue 
progressing past 9 reputation on the Reputation track . 
.....-. The Reputation Track and the Display ...., 
The game board has a display of 6 cards (see Bin the example: 
Taking cards using side II below). Next to these cards is the 
Reputation track, where you keep track of the reputation of your 
zoo (see A in the example: Taking cards using side II below). 
Whenever you are allowed to increase the reputation of your zoo 
♦, advance your counter 1 step on this track. To increase the 
reputation of your zoo to 10 (or more), you must have upgraded 
the Cards Action card to l!IIJI. 
The (IJ:-. icon on space 10 
(folder 5) serves as a reminder. 
The location of your counter determines which cards in the 
display are "within reputation range"for you. Within reputation 
range is the card on the same folder as your counter as well as 
all cards on the lower-numbered folders. This means that the 
higher your zoo's reputation, the more cards there are within your 
reputation range 
If you have taken one or more cards from the display, do not 
replenish the display until you have completed your entire 
turn. Then, move cards from the higher-numbered folders down 
to the lower-numbered folders. Do not change the order of the 
cards. Finally, fill each empty space with a card from the deck. 
Next to the display is the discard pile. You may not look through 
the discard pile during the game. 
If you advance your Reputation counter to a space with a bonus 
next to it, you take the bonus immediately and only once. If 
your counter has reached space 15 on the Reputation track and 
your zoo keeps receiving reputation, your counter will remain 
on space 15 and you instead take 1 appeal for each remaining 
j 
reputation step you are due. -------
Example: Taking cards using m" 11 
You are blue, and you are performing the action with strength 5, 
which lets you take 4 cards and discard 1. Above all, you would like 
to have the Lion that is within your reputation range in the display. 
You take the Lion (1 ), draw 2 cards from the deck (2) and then decide 
to also take the Caracal from the display (3). Then you discard a card 
from your hand. 
At the end of your action, the cards on folders 3, 5, and 6 move down 
(4) and you flip over 2 new cards for folders 5 and 6 (5). If the Lion had 
not been within reputation range, you would only have been able to 
obtain it by snapping. In that case, you would not have been allowed 
to draw any more cards, but you could have completed the action 
with strength 3 or 4. 
10 
BUILD 
51 
I 
Build exactly 1 building of your choice with 
a maximum size of l3 on your zoo map. Pay 
2 money per space. Available: Kiosk, pavilion, 
standard enclosure, and Petting Zoo. 
The size of a building is measured by the number of spaces 
it covers on your zoo map. In this action, you have the kiosk 
(size 1 ), pavilion (size 1 ), various standard enclosures (sizes 
1-5), and the Petting Zoo (special enclosure size 3) at your 
disposal. Each zoo can contain only 1 Petting Zoo. Other 
buildings can be built more than once. Your zoo map shows 
an overview of all the buildings. All standard enclosures of 
each size and all of the different special enclosures have the 
same shape. 
You need enclosures to accommodate animals, while kiosks 
grant you income during every break. Each pavilion you 
build immediately (and only once) increases the appeal of 
your zoo by 1. 
Pay the building cost into the general supply before placing 
the building on your zoo map. The cost of a building is twice 
the number of spaces it will cover, called the size. Therefore, 
cost= size x2 money. 
Build the building adjacent to an existing one, meaning at 
least 1 edge of the new building must touch an edge of an 
existing one. For your first building, instead, at least 1 space 
of it must be on a border space of your zoo map. 
You may only build on the empty spaces of your zoo map. 
Buildings may not extend beyond the edge of the map, 
overlap other buildings, or cover water or rock spaces. 
You are not allowed to build on spaces with the i..Cti 
icon yet. 
To do so, you must first upgrade your Build action card. 
A kiosk must always be at least 3 spaces from every other 
kiosk on your zoo map, meaning there must always be at 
least 2 spaces between 2 kiosks. The note below the partner 
zoo space on your zoo map serves as a reminder. 
If you cannot build the desired building on your zoo map 
according to the rules above, you must choose a different 
building. 
Build a standard enclosure with the empty side face-up so 
that it can still be occupied by an animal later. The empty side 
has a yellow edge and shows O, where X is the enclosure 
size. For the Petting Zoo both sides are the same. 
If you cover one or more spaces with a Q, you immediately 
take the corresponding placement bonus once. 
The bonuses are explained on the Icon overview. 
Example: 
Possible 
building spaces 
for a kiosk 
The green checkmarks 
indicate spaces 
where you may build 
another kiosk. 
Build as many differ~~~~~ildi!?is as you like 
with a maximum total size of t,;,t on your zoo 
map. Newly available: Large Bird Aviary and 
Reptile House. 
If you have upgraded the Build action, you may also build 
the special enclosures Large Bird Aviary and Reptile House 
(both size 5). Just like with the Petting Zoo, each zoo can only 
accommodate 1 Reptile House and 1 Large Bird Aviary. Both 
sides of these special enclosures are also the same. 
When you build the Reptile House or Large Bird Aviary, you 
may immediately move animals from a standard enclosure 
to the new special enclosure. You are not allowed to do this 
at any other time in the game. Please refer to the Animals 
action and page 12 specifically for more details on how 
special enclosures work. 
You cannot build unique buildings with this action, they 
only come into play with the associated Sponsor cards. 
In addition, you now have the opportunity to build several 
buildings with one action. However, you may not build 
2 identical buildings with the same Build action, each of them 
must be different. The total size of these buildings must not 
exceed l3. 
Build the buildings on your map one after the other. Pay 
for each building separately before you build it. If you cover 
a bonus icon, you immediately take the placement bonus 
before you build the next building. However, do not take any 
"after finishing" bonuses until the Build action is completed. 
Upgrading your Build action also allows you to build on the 
spaces of your zoo map with the i..(;j icon, meaning you can 
now completely cover your zoo map. If you cover every space 
of your zoo map, immediately increase the appeal of your 
zoo by 7. This can happen through the Build action, but also 
through another effect when something is built in your zoo. 
You must have covered every space on your zoo map, except 
for the water spaces and rock spaces. 
Example: Building with a placement bonus 
You are taking the Build action in card slot 5 and want to build a 
2-space and a 3-space standard enclosure. However, you only have 
7 money at your disposal and the two enclosures cost a total of 10. 
Since you are building your first enclosure on a placement bonus 
of 5 money (1 ), you take this bonus immediately after building the 
first enclosure. The money then becomes available to pay for your 
second enclosure (2). 
ANIMALS 
Play Animal cards from your hand. 
Compare the strength 13 
of the action with the table on the 
card. Play up to the indicated number of Animal cards from 
your hand. 
Follow the steps below for each animal: 
1. Check conditions: Any conditions you must fulfill in 
order to play the Animal card are indicated on the left 
side of the card. You can only play the card if you fulfill 
all the conditions (for example, a specific partner zoo 
or animal category as well as continent icons). 
The conditions are explained in the Icon overview. 
2. Pay cost: Pay the cost of the animal indicated in the 
upper-left corner of the Animal card. If you have a partner 
zoo on the continent from which the animal originates, 
this reduces the cost by 3 money per continent icon on 
the Animal card. Pay the money into the general supply. 
If you have a card that gains you money for playing the 
animal, you only take that money in a later step, meaning 
you must already have enough money beforehand to pay 
the full cost of the animal. 
3. Fill empty enclosure: To play an Animal card and 
accommodate the animal in your zoo, you need free 
spaces in an enclosure. You can place any animal, except 
Petting Zoo animals@, on its own into an empty 
standard enclosure. The enclosure must be at least the 
required size indicated in the upper-left corner of the 
Animal card. Then flip the enclosure over to its occupied 
side. Some animals also state that their enclosure needs 
to be next to one or two water and/or rock spaces. 
The enclosure requirements of an animal are indicated 
next to the size of the standard enclosure on the card. 
Petting Zoo animals cannot be accommodated in a 
standard enclosure, only in their special enclosure, 
the Petting Zoo. All reptiles and some birds can be 
accommodated either in a standard or in a special 
enclosure, the Reptile House and the Large Bird Aviary, 
respectively. In that case the card shows two different 
enclosure requirements, and you can choose whether 
to put the animal in a standard or special enclosure 
(for more details see Special Enclosures on page 12). 
4. Place Animal card: Place the Animal card next to your 
zoo map (see Placing Cards on page 13). 
5. Execute effects: Whenever you play an animal, the 
appeal of your zoo increases. Advance your counter on 
the Appeal track the number of steps indicated on the 
card. Some animals also give you conservation points or 
increase the reputation of your zoo. If so, also advance 
the counters on the corresponding tracks. Many animals 
have an additional effect when they are played. 
If the effect text contains "after finishing'; do not execute 
it until you have finished your entire Animals action. In all 
other cases, execute the effect immediately, even before 
playing another Animal card. The same applies to effects 
from other cards that are triggered by playing your 
Animal card. If there are multiple simultaneous effects, 
you choose the order of execution (whether these effects 
are appeal, reputation, conservation points, or gained by 
the ability of the animal or from other cards). 
II If your group doesn't like the interactive effects Q, you 
can instead use the alternate effects intended for the solo 
game (see Animal Card Layout on this page). 
If an action allows you to play 2 Animal cards, play them one 
after the other and complete all of the above steps for the 
first animal (except for effects with "after finishing") before 
doing the same again for the second animal. You may choose 
not to play a second Animal card. 
Only after that, and after you have moved the Animals Action 
card to slot 1 of your zoo map, execute the "after finishing" 
effects. If there are multiple effects of this type, you choose 
the order of execution. 
...... Animal Card Layout ,..... 
Animal cards represent the different animals you 
can accommodate in your zoo. 
(1) The upper-left corner explains the 
enclosure requirements you need to fulfil I. 
The number in the hexagon indicates the 
minimum size enclosure this animal may 
be placed in. (2) Next to it may appear 
1 or 2 rock and/or water icons. This means 
that the enclosure must be next to at least 
that many spaces of the depicted type(s). 
(3) If the animal can also go in a special 
enclosure, that type, and the spaces the 
animal occupies, are depicted just to the 
right of the normal enclosure requirements. 
The water and rock requirements also apply 
to the special enclosure. 
(4) Below the enclosure requirements is the 
money cost you must pay to play the card 
and accommodate the animal in your zoo.

(6) The upper-right corner shows the animal's 
category and (except for Petting Zoo animals) the 
continent from which it originates. These icons 
interact with all your other cards and are often 
important for completing conservation projects. 
(7) The lower-right corner shows the increase 
in your zoo's appeal after the animal has been 
accommodated. Some animals offer additional 
bonuses such as conservation points or reputation. 
(8) Many animals have an effect when played that 
is either executed immediately or following the 
Animals action (see Animal Abilities on Glossary 
pages 2-3.) If the Animal card's effect refers to an 
icon that appears on the card itself, that icon counts 
for the effect. 
Some Animal cards have an interactive 
effect Q e. g. Venom. This effect can only ~ 
apply to you if your zoo has 5 or more 
'6' 
appeal. The 5 space on the Appeal track 
•• • •• 
is marked as a reminder. See the Glossary 
for the effect details. 
(9) Some animals have a different effect in solo 
play, which is shown in a blue box with the .I. icon. 
...... Special Enclosures [Petting Zoo, Reptile House, Large Bird Aviary) ....-. 
There are 3 different special enclosures: Petting Zoo (1 ), Reptile 
House (2), and Large Bird Aviary (3). Your zoo can only have one 
of each type of special enclosure. 
Petting Zoo animals~ 
cannot be accommodated in a 
standard enclosure; only in their special enclosure, the Petting 
Zoo. 
All reptiles and some birds can be accommodated either in a 
standard or in a special enclosure, the Reptile House and the 
Large Bird Aviary, respectively. In that case the card shows two 
different enclosure requirements, and you can choose whether 
to put the animal in a standard or special enclosure. If an 
animal requires water and/or rock spaces next to its standard 
enclosure, the same requirement also applies to the respective 
special enclosure. 
Example: Playing animals (enclosures) 
You play the Broad-snouted Cai man 
and have 2 options to accommodate 
it in your zoo. You could put it in your 
5-space standard enclosure, since this is 
at least size 4 and next to a water space. 
Then you would flip the enclosure to its 
occupied side. But you would prefer to 
put the caiman into your Reptile House. 
This is also possible because it is next to 
water and has space for at least 2 of your 
player tokens. Place 2 of your tokens on 
the Reptile House. The 5-space enclosure 
is still available for another animal, such 
as a large non-reptilian. 
Snapping 1 
Gain any 1 card from the display. 
Example: Playing animals (immediate effect) 
If you want to accommodate the animal in a special enclosure, 
use player tokens from your supply to mark the number of 
enclosure spaces indicated in the special enclosure icon on 
the card. If there are not enough free spaces left in the special 
enclosure, you cannot accommodate the animal there. You 
never need to flip a special enclosure: Both sides of the tile are 
the same. 
If you build a Reptile House or a Large Bird Aviary and you 
already have animals in your zoo that could be accommodated 
there, you may immediately and only this once, move these 
animals into your corresponding new special enclosure. 
For each animal you move, find the smallest occupied standard 
enclosure that meets all of the animal's enclosure requirements 
(including water and rock spaces), and flip it back to its empty 
side. In the rare case there is no such enclosure, flip the smallest 
occupied standard enclosure that meets at least the animal's 
enclosure size requirement. Then mark the special enclosure 
with the corresponding number of player tokens. 
If you have several animals that could potentially be moved, 
you may decide for each animal separately whether you want 
to move it or not. 
You perform the Animals action with strength 5 to play 2 animals. First, you play the 
Eurasian Eagle-Owl (1 ). You pay the cost, flip over a 2-space enclosure (2), 
gain 4 appeal, and execute the card's effect, putting 2 new cards into your hand (3). 
Fortunately, the Eurasian Lynx is among them, which you prefer to play over the 
Marabou. Therefore, you decide to play the Eurasian Lynx as your second animal (4). 
Play Animal cards from your hand or within 
reputation range. 
Placing Cards 
If you have upgraded the Animals action, you may play 
animal cards directly from the display, instead of only from 
your hand. To do so, the respective card must be within 
your reputation range. In addition to the cost of the animal, 
you must pay an amount of money equal to the number on 
the folder from which you play the Animal card. If you are 
allowed to play 2 Animal cards, you may choose to play 2 
cards from your hand, 2 from the display, or 1 card from your 
hand and 1 card from the display. Play the animals one after 
the other. Do not replenish the display until you have finished 
In addition, you may increase the reputation of your zoo by 1, 
if you perform this action with a strength of at least I). 
Increase the reputation at the very beginning of your action, 
so that your reputation range for this action is already higher. 
Finally, after upgrading your Animals action, you may also 
play animals that have the [{I icon as a condition. 
Animal categories 
Place your played Sponsor 
and Animal cards overlapping 
each other to save space. All 
information you need for the rest 
of the game is shown at the top 
of the card. 
Some Sponsor cards have an 
additional effect at the end 
of the game. These cards are 
marked with a vertical brown 
strip behind the card level (such 
as on the 2nd card played in this 
example). This makes cards with 
endgame effects easier to find 
once they have been played. 
There are 7 animal categories 
in Ark Nova: 
()Bird 
2 of these 7 categories are special cases, bear• 
and Petting Zoo 
animal .ji.. Thus, in contrast to the other categories, their icon is 
black on a white background. 
QHerbivore 
QPredator 
()Primate 
f}Reptile 
Bear 
.ji. Petting Zoo animal 
The bears• 
are more of a subcategory. Their icon mostly occurs 
in combination with the herbivore Q or predator Q icon. 
For gameplay reasons, we invented a separate category for 
Petting Zoo animals .ji., replacing the biological category. 
If the game asks for animal categories, this implicitly includes 
bear and Petting Zoo animals as well. If this is ever not the case, 
they are explicitly excluded. 
Example: Playing animals using lfflrj11 
Constriction 
Each player ahead of you on a track 
gains 1 Constriction token for each of 
those tracks ( 0 and ([)).

You are red, and you use the upgraded Animals action to play 2 animals. 
Because you are performing the action with strength 5, you may first 
increase the reputation of your zoo by 1 to a reputation of 4 (1 ). This 
means that folders 1-3 are now within reputation range for you. 
You play the European badger from folder 3 of the display (2) and 
therefore pay 3 money in addition to the normal cost of the animal. 
Then you play another animal from your hand, the Crested Porcupine 
(3). After you have populated the respective enclosures, increased the 
appeal of your zoo, and used the abilities of the animals, your turn 
ends. Before the next player takes their turn, you replenish the display.

ASSOCIATION 
Perform exactly one association task. 
To carry out an association task, you need at least 1 active 
association worker on the notepad of your zoo map. Place 
this worker on the Association board on the task you want 
to perform. If 1 of your association workers is already on this 
task, you must instead place 2 to perform this task. If 3 of 
your association workers are already on this task, you cannot 
perform it again for the time being. Association workers in 
colors other than your own do not matter here. 
In a break, all your association workers return to your zoo 
map and become active again. As a result, all the tasks again 
become available to perform with 1 association worker. More 
about this in Break on page 18. 
Each task requires a different action strength £1. You can 
only perform an association task if your action's strength is at 
least as high as the task's value. 
The various tasks are: 
E'I Increasing reputation: Increase the reputation of 
g 
your zoo by 2. Advance your Reputation counter 
on the Reputation track and receive any bonus shown, if 
applicable. 
The reputation of your zoo determines how many cards you 
can access in the display (reputation range). In addition, 
a certain minimum reputation is required to play certain 
Sponsor cards (see Sponsors action page 17). 
IJ 
Gaining a partner zoo: Take a partner zoo from the 
Association board and place it on the lowest empty 
partner zoo space on your zoo map. If that space shows 
a bonus, take it once and immediately. You cannot take a 
partner zoo that you already have, all your partner zoos must 
be from different continents. Also, you may take a maximum 
of 4 partner zoos in total; your zoo map does not have space 
for a 5th. To take a third (or fourth) partner zoo, you must 
have upgraded the Association action to llmlll-
If you 
already have all the partner zoos that are on the Association 
board at that moment, or if you cannot place the partner 
zoo on your zoo map, you cannot perform this task. In the 
break, the supply of partner zoos on the Association board is 
replenished (see Break page 18). 
Each partner zoo reduces the cost of playing all Animal cards 
from its continent by 3 money per continent icon on the 
Animal card. It also provides you 1 icon of the respective 
continent, which may trigger other card effects and may 
count towards conservation projects. Certain Animal cards 
require a partner zoo from the same continent. 
:1'11 
Gaining a partner university:Take a university 
Ii.I 
from the Association board and place it on the 
lowest available university space of your zoo map. If that 
space shows a bonus, take it once and immediately. You 
also advance your Reputation counter accordingly if this is 
depicted on the university. You cannot take a university you 
already have. So, if you already have all the universities that 
are on the Association board at that moment, you cannot 
perform this task. In the break, the supply of universities on 
the Association board is replenished (see Break page 18). 
Universities increase the reputation of your zoo, grant 
research icons, and are the only way to increase your hand 
limit to 5 cards . 
....,.., The Association Board 
The Association board is divided into 2 areas. In the blue area are the tasks that you can perform using your association workers. 
If you have not upgraded the Association action, you can only perform exactly 1 of these tasks. In the pink area, after upgrading 
your Association action card, you can gain additional conservation points by donating to animal conservation organizations. 
Above and below the Association board are the spaces for the conservation projects that you can support during the game.

:1:1 Conservation project work: You may either support 
1:.1 a conservation project already in play or play a 
Conservation Project card from your hand and support 
it immediately. If you bring a new Conservation Project 
card into play, place it above the Association board on the 
leftmost space. If there is already a conservation project 
there, move all the Conservation Project cards above 
the board one place to the right before placing the card. 
Depending on your player count, there can only be up to 
2, 3 or 4 cards above the Association board. If (after placing 
the new conservation project) there are more cards above 
the board than is allowed for your player count, put the 
rightmost card on the discard pile. Return any player tokens 
on the discarded card to the supply (not to the zoo map) of 
the corresponding player. The base conservation projects 
below the Association board are never moved even when 
they are fully supported. Also no new base conservation 
projects are added during the game. 
To support a conservation project, you must fulfill a condition 
(depicted on the card) that has no player token on it. You are 
only allowed to support each conservation project once. This 
means you cannot support a project that already has one of 
your player tokens on it. 
Place 1 player token of your choice from the left side of 
your zoo map on the condition you fulfill, and as a reward 
advance your Conservation counter and Reputation counter 
(if applicable) as per the depicted award on the card. If you 
can fulfil I more than one condition, you choose which one. 
An explanation of the various conservation projects is in the 
Glossary on page 1. 
When you take the player token from your zoo map, you 
activate the corresponding bonus. You always gain the bonus 
immediately. With some of them, you also gain the bonus 
again during each break. Choose whether you take this 
bonus before or after the reward for the conservation project. 
The bonuses are explained in the Icon overview. 
m Tip: It is sometimes worthwhile to support a conservation project 
on a lower level, for example in order to get the bonuses on the 
Conservation track or to activate an income on the left side of 
your zoo map early in the game. 
Example: Playing a Conservation Project card 
You play a new Conservation Project card from 
your hand: Large Animals. Since there are 
three players and 3 conservation projects are 
already out, you must first discard the rightmost 
Conservation Project card (Reptile Breeding 
Program) (1 ), move the other two project 
cards one position to the right (2), and then 
place the new Large Animals card in the newly 
available space on the left (3). Since you have 
3 large animals in your zoo, take a player token 
from your zoo map and place it on the middle 
condition (4). For this you gain 3 conservation 
points. You also get the bonus on the space from 
which you took your player token, which was to 
immediately (and only once) take 3 X-tokens. 
....., Conservation Projects Layouts ,.,.... 
These cards represent the different conservation projects you 
can support. Each card depicts 3 conditions (1) to fulfil I, as well 
as the corresponding rewards (2). Certain Conservation Project 
cards grant an additional bonus to the player who plays them 
(3). There are two types of conservation projects. 
Requires reptile icons 
In most cases, you must have a 
certain number of a specific icon 
in your zoo (in the example to 
the left, Reptiles). Count the icons 
on the top edge of all your cards, 
both on Animal and Sponsor cards 
(including the water or rock space 
requirements, but not including 
the conditions on the left) as 
well as on your partner zoos and 
universities. 
Conservation projects in which 
you release an animal into the 
wild work slightly differently. 
Instead of collecting a number of 
icons, you must discard 1 Animal 
card with a specific icon from 
your zoo (in this case, Africa A). 
You choose the matching animal 
to discard but the animal must 
require a standard enclosure of 
the depicted size (B).Whether 
the animal can also be placed in 
a special enclosure is irrelevant to 
the condition. Move your Appeal 
counter back as many steps as indicated on the Animal card. 
Remove the appropriate number of player tokens from your 
special enclosure (if you can) OR flip the smallest occupied 
standard enclosure that meets the animal's requirements from 
the occupied side to the empty side. Place the Animal card on 
the discard pile. See Glossary page 1 for details to Release into 
\, the Wild conservation projects.

Example: Releasing an animal 
You decide to release your African Spurred Tortoise into the 
Serengeti National Park. The tortoise needs a 3-space enclosure 
and thus fulnlls the middle condition, which is still unclaimed. You 
decide to mark the remaining space on the Conservation Project 
card with your player token from the "12 money" space (1 ). 
As the animal leaves your zoo, you remove 
2 player tokens from your Reptile House 
and take them back into your supply. You 
move your counter on the Appeal track 
back 6 steps (the animal's appeal). The 
other information on the card doesn't 
matter. Then you advance your counter on 
the Conservation track 4 steps and take 
12 money (since you took the player token 
from the corresponding bonus space). 
Finally, you place the African Spurred 
Tortoise card on the discard pile (2). 
~=;=~·J 
You may sel upto l cards from 
)OU!' h.widforQuch. 
Example: Association tasks with {ffirj11 
You decide to spend an X-token for the Association action in card 
slot 5 to execute it with strength 6. You gain one university and 
2 reputation with one association worker each (1 ). In addition, 
you pay 5 money as a donation and gain one conservation point 
for it (2). The next donation will cost 7 money. 
Perform one or more different association 
tasks. You may make one donation. 
If you have upgraded the Association action, you may 
perform several different association tasks with one action. 
For each task, you need 1 or 2 of your association workers. 
The total value of all association tasks may not exceed the 
strength l3 of your action. The total value may be less. 
If you select to perform conservation project work and 
support a new Conservation Project card, you may play that 
card directly from the display. The card you play must be 
within your reputation range. As an additional cost, you must 
pay an amount of money equal to the number on the folder 
from which you play the Conservation Project card. Do not 
replenish the display until you have completed your turn. 
In addition to the association tasks, you are allowed to make 
exactly 1 donation to an animal welfare program. Pay the 
smallest amount of money visible in the "donation" area (I!]) 
into the general supply and then cover the corresponding 
space with one of your player tokens from your supply so 
that the amount of money on this space is no longer visible. 
You gain 1 conservation point for this. If all spaces but the 
last one are occupied by player tokens, each subsequent 
donation costs 12 money, and you do not have to place any 
more tokens on that space. 
To be able to make a donation, you must have performed 
at least 1 association task during the same action. You do 
not need an association worker to make a donation. You can 
make a maximum of 1 donation per Association action. 
SPONSORS 
Play exactly 1 Sponsor card OR advance the 
Break token and take money. 
This action allows you to play exactly ~onsor 
card from 
your hand, provided that the strength U of the action is at 
least equal to the level of the Sponsor card and you meet any 
conditions on the card (depicted on the left side of the card). 
Execute the instant effect (if available) and/or the recurring 
effect of the card (if available and triggered by the icon on 
this Sponsor card), then place it next to your zoo map. 
:1'11 Alternatively~u 
can use this action to advance the 
W' Break token U steps and take l3 money for doing so. 
You still take l3 money even if the Break token doesn't need 
all l3 steps to reach the final space. 
Play one or more Sponsor cards OR advance 
the Break token and take money. 
If you have upgraded the Sponsors action, you can play 
multiple Sponsor cards with one action. The strength l3 
of your action plus 1 must be at least as high as the sum of 
the levels on all played cards (remember, with the help of 
X-tokens you can also increase the l3 beyond D- Play the 
cards one after the other, meaning you completely execute 
all the instant effects of one card (except for"after finishing" 
effects) before playing the next card. 
When playing Sponsor cards, you may choose to play them 
from the display or your hand. Any cards played from 
the display must be within your reputation range. Pay an 
additional amount of money equal to the number on 
the folder from which you play the Sponsor card. Do not 
replenish the display until you have completed your turn. 
If you use the Sponsors action to advance the Break token, 
you take l3 money twice. 
Finally, after upgrading your Sponsors action, you may also 
play Sponsor cards that have the [i 
icon as a condition. 
Example: Playing a Sponsor card 
Use the Sponsors action to play the Meerkat Den 
card (see above). You need an action strength 
of 5 and the reputation of your zoo must be at 
least 3. You take the Meerkat Den from the unique 
buildings and place it on your zoo map, next to at 
least 1 rock. You can recognize the Meerkat Den 
by the icon in the lower-left corner of the card. 
Since the Meerkat Den card itself has a herbivore 
icon, the appeal of your zoo immediately 
increases by 2. 
....., Sponsor cards Layout ,,.,..,. 
(1) The level for each Sponsor card is in its upper-left corner. 
(2) If the card lets you place a special building in your zoo, 
and this building must be built next to water or rocks, this 
requirement is shown next to the level (where it would also 
be on Animal cards). (3) Any conditions that you must fulfil! in 
order to play the card are shown on the left side of the card. (4) 
If the card itself provides a icon, it is depicted in the upper-right 
corner. 
Sponsor cards can have a variety of different effects. (5) If the 
card has a recurring effect, this is shown at the top of the card 
on a blue background, unless it gives you income during every 
break, in which case the background is purple. 
®• Each time you play a herbivore icon 
into your zoo, gain [l]. 
Place next to at least 1 rock space. 
(6) A one-off effect when playing the card is indicated by a 
yellow background in the lower-left corner of the card. (7) 
An effect during the final scoring is indicated by a brown 
background in the lower-right corner of the card. A vertical 
brown strip behind the card level (1) serves as a reminder that 
this card has an effect in the final scoring (in case you place the 
cards overlapping each other). 
If an effect on a Sponsor card refers to an icon that appears 
on the Sponsor card itself, this icon counts for the effect or for 
triggering the effect. However, only the icons in the upper-right 
corners of cards (4) are used, not those anywhere else on the 
card, except for the rock and water icons, which are in the upper-
I eft corner. 
(8) Some effects are already explained on the Sponsor card itself; 
\ all card effects are explained on Glossary pages 4-7. 
) 
X-TOKEN 
Take 1 X-token. 
If you cannot or do not want to perform any of the 5 actions, 
you can still use this alternative action and take 1 X-token. 
You can perform this action using any Action card. It is 
independent of the l3 value of the card's slot and you 
cannot use X-tokens to increase the strength of the action. It 
doesn't matter whether the Action card has been upgraded. 
You must still select an Action card, move it to slot 1, and shift 
the intervening cards to the right. Then, take an X-token. If 
you already have 5 X-tokens, you cannot perform this action . 
.......................... 
v .......................................... 
Appeal and Conservation Points 
During the game you increase the appeal of your zoo and 
collect conservation points. This is necessary to win and also 
helps you during the game. 
The appeal of your zoo determines how much money you 
earn in each break. 
Additionally, there are 4 spaces on the Conservation track 
that provide an immediate one-time effect when you reach 
or pass them. Those spaces are the following: 
• 2 conservation points: 
Either upgrade one of your Action cards 
(flip it over) or activate an additional 
association worker (take a lying down 
worker from the lowest space below the 
notepad and place it onto the notepad). Either option is 
available to each player who reaches space 2. 
• S I B conservation points: 
Take either 5 money or one of the 
bonus tokens next to this space on the 
Conservation track. Execute the effect 
(money or Bonus token) immediately. 
If you take a Bonus token, remove it 
from the game afterwards. The option 
to take 5 money remains even after 
both Bonus tokens are gone. 
• 1 O conservation points: 
The first time a player reaches, or exceeds, 
1 o Conservation Points, all players choose 
and discard one of their Final Scoring cards. 
Place them facedown under the 
pile of remaining Final Scoring cards. If 
no one accrues 1 O Conservation Points 
before the game ends, all players must 
choose and discard a Final Scoring card 
before end game scoring can begin. 
Break 
Ark Nova does not follow a fixed round system. You take 
turns, taking 1 turn at a time, until the Break token has 
advanced to the last space of the Break track ii •. An Action 
card, Sponsor card, or Animal card effect could cause this to 
happen. If you trigger the break, gain 1 X-token. Complete 
your current turn, take the Break token, and then all players 
perform the following steps in order: 
1. Hand card limit: 
--~ 
If you have more cards in your hand than your 
([] 1: hand limit allows, discard any surplus cards of 
(ctfsl), your choice from your hand to the discard pile. 
_'l,Ji;'..J 
__ : Normally your hand limit is 3, but a particular 
university allows you to hold 5 (\\[)). 
2. Tokens on Action cards: 
~11:\ 2 
If you have Multiplier, Venom, and/or 
W 
Constriction tokens on your Action cards, 
return them to the supply. They no longer 
have any effect. 
3. Association board: 
Return all your association workers from 
the Association board to the notepad on 
your zoo map. They become available to 
you again as active workers. Replenish the 
display of partner zoos and universities so that exactly 
one of each partner zoo and university is now available 
again.There is no need to replenish universities and 
partner zoos that all players already have. 
4. Replenish display: 
Discard the two bottom cards of the display 
(folders 1 and 2) to the discard pile, move 
the remaining cards down and replenish 
the display. The icon ii ~ 
on folders 1 
and 2 serves as a reminder. 
5. Take income: 
Most of the time, all players can take their income 
simultaneously. Some effects may require this to happen 
in player order, such as multiple players having an effect 
that allows them to take a card from the display. In 
these situations, affected players should take income in 
clockwise order starting from the player who initiated the 
Break. The display is replenished after each player. 
a. Collect income according to the appeal of your zoo. 
Take the amount of money indicated next to your 
counter on the Appeal track. 
Example: If your counter is on space 7 of the Appeal track, 
take 11 money. 
b. Collect income for the kiosks on your zoo map. Check 
each kiosk on your zoo map separately. Take 1 money 
for each unique building, special enclosure, occupied 
standard enclosure, and pavilion adjacent to it. A 
building must share at least one side of one space with 
a kiosk in order to be considered adjacent to it. An 
empty standard enclosure does not provide income 
(but an empty special enclosure does). 
c. Collect all the income indicated by the following icon: 
. The icon appears on some Sponsor cards and 
in some bonuses on the left side of your zoo map. 
Take only the bonuses on your zoo map that you 
have already activated (those you have uncovered by 
placing the player token on a conservation project). 
6. Break track: 
~! 
Return the Break token to the starting 
space for your player count. 
Then the break ends, and the game continues with the next 
player in clockwise order taking their next turn. 
END OF GAMES FINAL SCORING 
1.Gameend 
If at the end of your turn or during a break your 
Conservation counter and Appeal counter are ever 
in the same scoring area, or if they have passed one 
another, the end of the game is triggered. Each scoring 
area comprises one space of the Conservation track and 
the adjacent spaces of the Appeal track. 
If the end of the game is triggered at the end of your 
turn, all other players (but not you) will take one more 
turn. The next time it would be your turn, move on to 
final scoring instead. If the end of the game is triggered 
during a break, all players (including you) will take one 
more turn. 
2. Score cards 
At the end of the game, you still get conservation points 
or appeal from your Final Scoring card(s), as well as from 
all your cards with an end-of-game icon ~- Remember, 
if no player reached 1 O conservation points, all players 
should discard one of their Final Scoring cards before 
adding these points to their totals. 
3. Determine Victory Points 
Finally, it's time to tally Victory Points. Find the little white 
number in the space where your conservation counter 
is located. Add this number to the value of your appeal 
counter to get your Victory Points total. 
The player with the highest Victory Point total is the 
winner. In case of a tie, the tied player who supported 
the most Conservation Projects wins the game (you can 
determine this by counting how many player tokens have 
been removed from the left side of your zoo map). If the 
score is still a tie, all tied players share the victory. 
You may have noticed that in order to win the game your appeal 
counter and conservation counter have to cross one another! 
Keep that in mind as you make decisions to maximize your score! 
Example: Game end 
Red has 64 appeal and 
20 conservation points. 
Both counters are in the 
same scoring area (white 
frame). 
The game end is triggered. 
Example: Income for kiosks 
You take 4 money for your kiosks, 2 money for each of them. 
( 
Final Scoring Card Layout ,,,.,... 
Each Final Scoring card uses either a table (below, left) or text 
(below, right) to indicate how you can gain 1-4 additional 
Conservation Points at the end of the game. For scoring 
purposes, consider your universities and the cards in front 
of you and the icons on them. You can never gain more than 
4 conservation points from a single Final Scoring card. 
Gain () for Sponsor cards 
in your zoo.

Example: Determine Victory Points 
(1) Blue has 16 conservation points; the little white number 
in that space is 24. Blue has 80 appeal. 
Blues total score is (24 + 80 =) 104 Victory Points . 
(3) Red has 18 conservation points; the little white number 
in that space is 30. Red has 78 appeal. 
Reds total score is (30 + 78 =) 108 Victory Points.

SOLO GAME • ....._. • • • • • • 
-.-.-• 
•-••• 
• 6 4 
I•-•~-
6 6 6 6 W 
If you play Ark Nova on your own, modify the rules as follows: 
Setup 
• Lay out 3 basic Conservation Project cards and do not place 
any tokens of a different color on them (i. e. like a 3-player 
setup). 
• Do not use the Break token. Instead, place 7 player tokens of 
any unused col or on the spaces in the left column of the big 
solo tile (A). 
• You start the game with 20 appeal. Place the little solo tile on 
space 45 of the appeal track, with the matching side up (B). 
Turn/ Cards 
Cards with interactive effects have a blue stripe at the bottom 
with the~ 
icon; the contents of the blue stripe replace the 
card's interactive effect with an appropriate solo effect. You 
will find this feature on 1 Final Scoring card and a number of 
Animal cards. 
When playing a Sponsor card with the condition "max. 25 
appeal'; treat it as saying max. 45 appeal instead. The tile on 
the appeal track reminds you of that. 
There can be up to 2 Conservation Project cards above the 
Association board. 
If you perform an action that would advance the Break token, 
it simply doesn't. If you would take money for moving it, you 
still get the money. You do not get an X-token for triggering a 
break (see Gameplay I Breaks to the right). 
Examples: You play the Cougar with the ability Jump 3. Although 
there is no Break token to advance, you still take 3 money. 
You use the upgraded Sponsors action with a strength X of 4 for 
the break ability. Although there is no Break token to advance, you 
still take 8 money. 
Gameplay / Breaks 
Every time you end a turn, move the topmost player token in 
the left column of the solo tile onto the space to its right (in 
the right column) (1 ). If you move the last token from the left 
column into the right column (2) (and thus reveal the break 
icon), you immediately resolve a break. 
At the beginning of the break, place the topmost player token 
onto the open donation space with the smallest number 
on the Association board (3) (if all the other spaces, except 
for space 12, are already occupied place it next to space 12, 
even if this has no effect on the donations) and move the 
remaining tokens back into the left column of the solo tile 
(but now 1 more row is empty). 
Then perform all steps of a break except for step 6. 
Example: Setup and Gameplay 
The game ends after 6 rounds, when only 2 tokens are left on 
the solo tile and you moved the bottom one to the right. Do 
not trigger another break, but do the final scoring instead. 
If you have at least 100 Victory Points after the final scoring 
(meaning both your Appeal counter and Conservation 
counter have reached the same scoring area or passed each 
other), you have won the solo game. 
Difficulty Levels/ Solo Challenge 
We recommend that beginners start the solo game with 
an appeal of 20. Depending on your experience, you could 
instead start the game with 1 o or even o appeal. When 
starting with 1 0 appeal, turn the little solo tile to the 35 side 
and place it on the matching space on the appeal track. Treat 
the condition "max. 25 appeal" as saying "max. 35 appeal''. 
When starting with 0 appeal, don't use the little solo tile. 
Starting the solo game with 0 appeal is quite a challenge! Feel 
free to play as many games as you like at each difficulty level. 
As a special challenge, play 3 games in a row. In this case, 
do not shuffle the cards after each game. Instead, remove all 
cards from that particular game (discard pile, display, all of 
your cards, and all of the conservation projects) and set up 
the game with the remaining cards. Also remove the two zoo 
maps you had to choose from, as well as the 4 Bonus tiles. 
For the third game, you will have to reuse a random 3 of the 
removed Bonus tiles. 
You no longer have access to the cards that are out of play, 
with the only exception being the animal abilities Assertion 
and Dominance. 
At the end of each game, record your score; then total all 
3 scores at the very end. If the sum is at least 300 you have 
passed the challenge!
