Ark Nova 
Introduction: In Ark Nova each player plans and builds a modern, scientifically managed zoo. 
Game End and Goal: The game ends when a player’s Conservation and Appeal markers meet/pass each other. They finish their turn. All 
other players take one more turn. Perform final scoring, and the player with the highest positive difference between their markers wins. 
Board Setup: 
1. 
Place the Game Board in the middle of the table. Take the Break Token (mug) and place it on the start space on the Break Track 
that corresponds to your player count (1-4). 
2. 
Shuffle the 9 Bonus Tiles (yellow pentagons), and place one on each of the 4 Bonus Tile spaces (under the ‘5’ and ‘8’ space of 
the Conservation Track). Return the remaining 5 Bonus Tiles to the box. 
3. 
Shuffle the 212 Zoo Cards to create a face-down deck on the game board (right middle). Deal 6 face-down cards from the deck 
to the spaces in the middle of the board. 
4. 
Place the 2 Black Trays next to the game board as the general supply. Contains all the game tiles. 
5. 
Place the Association Board next to the game board. Leave enough room for a row of cards above and below it. 
a. 
Place 1 Partner Zoo per continent and 1 University of each kind on the spaces of the Association Board. 
b. 
Shuffle the 12 Base Conservation Project Cards (Shield), and place them face-down left of the Association Board. In a 
4/3/2P game, place 4/3/3 base conservation cards face-up below the association board. 
c. 
In a 2P game only: Take 6 player tokens of an unused colour and block the following spaces: 
i. The left/middle/right level on the left/middle/right Base Conservation Card, respectively. 
ii. All 3 Donations in the left column of the Donation section of the Association Board. 
6. 
Shuffle the 11 Final Scoring Cards (egg-timer), and place them face-down next to the Association Board. 
7. 
Randomly determine a Start Player. 
Personal Setup: 
If this is your first game, each player takes a ‘Map A’ Zoo Map (indicated middle right). All A Maps are identical. 
If this is your second game, each player should take a ‘Map 0’ Zoo Map. All 0 Maps are identical. 
Thereafter, shuffle all 8 Zoo Maps, and deal 2 to each player. The back faces of the Zoo Maps are numbered 1-8, and the player 
should select the map they prefer. Each map also has a special player power. 
Each player takes 1 set of Action Cards (blue/burgundy), 1 each of Build/Cards/Sponsor/Association/Animals), and places 
them Blue Side up below their Zoo Map as follows: Place Animals in slot 1. Shuffle the remaining 4 cards, and place one in each 
of the 4 remaining slots. 
Each player chooses a colour (R/Y/G/B), and places their pieces as follows: Place your 3 counters (hex cylinders): 1 on the first 
space of the Conservation Track (top R), 1 on the first space of the Reputation Track (mortarboard hat), and 1 on the Appeal 
track according to player order (P1/P2/P3/P4 = space 0/1/2/3 of Appeal Track). 
Take 7 Player Tokens (cubes), and place one on each of the spaces on the left of your Zoo Map. Leave the remaining 
18 player tokens near your Zoo Map for later use. 
Take your 4 Association Workers (busts), and place one on your notepad as an available worker, and the other three 
lying down on the correspondingly shaped spaces of your Zoo Map (RHS). 
Each player takes 25 Money from the supply and puts it on their Notepad. 
Each player draws 2 Final Scoring Cards, reviews them, and stores them face-down next to their Zoo Map (they may review 
these cards at any time, but must not reveal them to the other players). 
8. 
Each player draws 8 Zoo Cards. They choose 4 to keep and discards the other 4 (face-up) to the discard pile. The Zoo Cards in 
your hand are secret from the other players. 
9. 
Finally, reveal the 6 Zoo Cards in the central display. 
Course of Play: Beginning with the first player, players take turns until the game end is triggered. The game is punctuated with Breaks 
(which occur when the break marker reaches the end of its track) and provides income and refreshes game tiles. 
A Player’s Turn: On their turn, a player performs 1 Action, using one of their Action Cards. The strength of the action they take is equal 
to the slot number the card is in, in their action row (1-5). Resolve the action, then slide the other cards left of that card as far right as 
possible (maintaining 1 card per slot), then slide the resolved action card into the now empty slot 1. Then, resolve any ‘after finishing’ 
effects from any zoo cards in your tableau. 
X-Tokens: Each X-Token a player commits with their action increases its strength by 1. A player may use as many X-Tokens as they wish, 
however, for some actions, there is no benefit over 5 Strength. A player is limited to holding a maximum of 5 X-Tokens. A player cannot 
use X-Tokens they gain during an action to further increase its strength. 
Upgrading your Action Cards: At the beginning of the game, all players’ Action Cards are on Side I. If a player receives a card upgrade 
action in-game, you may flip an Action Card of your choice to its upgraded side (maintaining its slot). From now on, that Action has a more 
powerful effect. 
There are 5 Card Actions: Cards, Animals, Build, Association, Sponsors, as well as the X-Token Action. 
Action 1: Cards: 
Action Side I: Advance the Break Token 2 spaces (irrespective of which option you choose), then, 

• 
Draw cards from the deck. Check the strength of the action you are performing. Then check the table on the ‘Cards’ Action Card 
and draw cards from the deck according to strength. Then, discard a card (if indicated in the table). This card can come from your 
existing hand or the cards you just drew. 
or, Snap. If you perform the Cards action at a strength of 5, you can instead take exactly 1 card from the display into your hand. 
You make take any card from the display, regardless of your current reputation. 
o 
Refill the display at the end of your turn by sliding the cards left to fill gaps, and top from the draw deck. 
Your hand limit at the start of the game is 3 cards and can be increased to 5 using the appropriate university. Your hand 
limit is only checked during break and may exceed this limit the rest of the time. 
Action Side II: Advance the Break Token 2 spaces (irrespective of which option you choose). Then: 
Draw cards from the deck and/or within reputation range, or, 
Within reputation range = from the display, up to the display space your reputation marker has reached. 
The display is not refreshed until the end of your turn. 
Snap. You can now snap from Strength 3 upwards. The strength of a snap does not affect its effect. 
Reputation Track: 
Upgrading your Cards Action to Side II has the benefit of allowing your reputation to continue progressing past 9. 
Whenever you advance your reputation counter to a space with a bonus by it, gain that bonus immediately, once. 
If you reach the end of the reputation track and need to advance, instead gain 1 Appeal per rep. you can’t gain. 
Action 2: Build: Note: First building must be built adjacent to edge of board. All later builds must be adjacent to an existing building. 
Build Side I: Build exactly 1 Building of your choice, with a maximum size of [Action Strength] on your zoo map. Pay 2 Money per 
space covered by the building. 
The size of a Building is the # of spaces it covers. You must pay the Building’s cost before placing it. Cost = size x2. 
Available buildings: Kiosk (size 1), Pavilion (size 1), Standard Enclosures (sizes 1-5), and Petting Zoo (size 3). Your zoo can only 
contain 1 Petting Zoo. Large Bird Aviary and Reptile House not available. 
Enclosures accommodate animals, Kiosks provide income during Break (but can only be placed a minimum of 3 spaces away 
from each other). Each pavilion increases your appeal by 1 (once). 
You may only build on vacant spaces of your zoo map. You can’t build on spade spaces of your map until the ‘Build Action’ is 
upgraded to Side II. 
When you build a Standard Enclosure, place it ‘empty’ side up. Petting Zoos are the same on both sides. 
If you cover 1 or more spaces with a Bonus Icon, immediately take the corresponding placement bonus, once. 
Certain animals have adjacency requirements for their enclosures (rocks/water). Ensure you these requirements with your placement of 
the intended enclosure. 
Build Side II: Build as many different buildings as you like with a maximum total size of [Strength]. Building rules are as above with the 
following changes: 
You may now build all types of building including Reptile House and Large Bird Aviary. Each Zoo can only have at most one Large 
Bird Aviary and one Reptile House. Both sides of the tile are identical. 
When you build a Reptile House or Large Bird Aviary, you may immediately, and only once for each building move eligable 
animals from standard enclosures to the new enclosure. Once you have made this transfer, the emptied Standard Enclosures 
flip to their empty side. 
You cannot build unique buildings with this action (they are built using the Sponsor action). 
You cannot build 2 identical buildings using this action. 
Build each building sequentially, paying immediately before building the building. Once all construction is complete, then resolve 
any ‘after finishing’ bonuses. 
Once you have upgraded to Side II, you are permitted to build on the ‘spade’ spaces on your Zoo Map. 
If you cover every space of your Zoo Map with Buildings, immediately increase your Zoos appeal by 7. 
Action 3: Animals 
Animals Side I: Play animal cards from your hand (consult the table on the Action Card, and use the Action’s [strength] to determine how 
many animal cards you may place). Follow these steps for each animal you place: 
Check Conditions: You must ensure that your zoo and intended enclosure meet all conditions specified on the Animal Card you 
with to place. These are listed down the left hand side of the Animal Card. This may include: Adjacency to Rocks or Water, 
Minimum enclosure size, (and whether it can share a Special Enclosure (aviary or reptile house), Science Icons, Zoo Partnerships 
with certain continents, Continent tags etc. The icons in the top right are the icons you gain from placing the Animal. 
Pay Cost: Pay the amount of money specified to the supply. If you have a partner zoo from the continent of origin of the Animal, 
reduce this cost by 3 Money per matching continent icon in the top right of that Animal Card. You must be able to afford the full 
cost of the Animal before placing it. 
Fill Empty Enclosure: To play an animal card you must have an available enclosure of at least the required size. 
You can place any animal (except Petting Zoo animals) into an enclosure provided the enclosure is at least as large as 
the minimum enclosure size requirement of the Animal. Flip the enclosure to its occupied side. 
Some animals have adjacency requirements for their enclosures (near water or rocks) which must be met. 
You can place Petting Zoo animals in the Petting Zoo (never in a standard enclosure). 
Some birds may be accommodated in either a standard enclosure or the large bird aviary (see each card). 
All reptiles may be accommodated in either a standard enclosure, or the reptile house. 
If you want to accommodate an animal in a special enclosure, use player tokens from your supply to mark the number 
of enclosure spaces indicated in the special enclosure icon of that Animal Card. If there is insufficient space to fit the 
animal, it cannot be placed there. Special enclosures never need to be flipped. 
Remember: If you place a bird or reptile in a standard enclosure, and build a bird or reptile house later, immediately 
on building, you may transfer birds/reptiles respectively to the new enclosure. 
Place Animal Card: Place the Animal Card next to your Zoo Map. 
Resolve Effects: Effects are in the text of the card, and in icons at the bottom. 
All animals increase the Appeal of your zoo. Advance your appeal token the indicated number of spaces. 
Some Animals increase the Conservation of your zoo. Advance your Conservation Token as indicated. 
Some Animals increase the Reputation of your zoo. Advance your Reputation Token as indicated. 
Many Animals have additional effects. If the effect is ‘after finishing’ resolve all Animal placements before resolving the 
effect. Otherwise resolve it immediately. 
Also resolve any effects that the placement of the Animal triggers on other cards in your tableau. If there are multiple 
other effects triggered, you choose the order of resolution. 
If you are placing multiple animals, complete one placement before starting the next. 
Animals Side 2: Play Animal Cards from your hand, or directly from the display within reputation range. The action’s Strength is 
compared with the table on the ‘Animals’ Action Card to determine how many animals. 
If you perform this action with a Strength of at least 5, you may increase your Zoo’s reputation by 1. Do this BEFORE playing 
Animals, so you benefit from the increased reputation range. 
If you play an Animal Card from the display, it must be within your reputation range. In addition to normal costs, you must 
pay money equal to the folder number adjacent to the animal. Do not replenish the display until you have finished your turn. 
By upgrading the Animals Action, you may also now play Animals that have Animals Side II as a requirement. 
Action 4: Association 
Association Side I: Do exactly 1 Association Task (from the choices below). 
You must have at least 1 Active Association Worker on your zoo map to do this action. 
If 1 of your Association Workers is already on this task (ie you did it once), instead place 2 to perform this task. 
If 3 of your Association Workers are on this task (i.e. you did it twice) you can’t do this action until after next Break. 
Each Association Task requires a different minimum Action Strength as follows: 
Increase Reputation (Strength 2): Increase the reputation of your Zoo by 2. Gain any bonus shown. The reputation of your Zoo determines 
your reputation range for drawing cards, and certain Sponsor Cards require a min. reputation to play. 
Gain A Partner Zoo (Strength 3): Take an available Partner Zoo token (of a continent you don’t already have), and place it in the lowest 
available Partner Zoo slot on your player board. If the space shows a bonus, gain it once, immediately. You can only gain a maximum of 4 
Partner Zoos out of the 5 available. To take your 3rd or 4th Partner Zoo, you must have upgraded the Association Action to Side II. The 
Partner Zoos available are replenished during Break. Each Partner Zoo you have reduces the cost of playing Animal Cards from its continent 
by 3 money for each continent icon on the Animal Card (top R only). It also provides you with 1 Continent Icon of its respective continent 
which may trigger other card effects or count towards conservation projects. Certain Animal Cards also require a partner zoo from the 
same continent to be played. 
Gain a Partner University (Strength 4): Take a University from the Association board (that you do not already have), and place it on the 
lowest available university space on your Zoo Map. If the space depicts a bonus, gain it immediately, once. Advance your Reputation 
Marker if the University gives you reputation. Universities are replenished during Break. Universities may give you Reputation, Research 
Icons, and increase your hand size to 5. 
Conservation Project Work (Strength 5): You may either: (1) Support a Conservation Project already in play, or, (2) play a new 
Conservation Project from your hand, and support it immediately. 
If you play a new conservation project, place it above the Association Board, in the leftmost space. If there is a conservation project already 
in that space, slide the projects right to make space for it. In a 2/3/4P game there is a limit of 2/3/4 Conservation Projects above the 
Association Board – if this limit is exceeded, the rightmost project is discarded (return any player tokens on it to supply, not the respective 
player’s Zoo Board). 
To support a Conservation project, you must fulfil one of its vacant conditions. You can only support each Conservation Project once. Select 
1 player token from the left side of your Zoo Map, and place it on the condition you fulfil. Gain the reward(s) depicted on the 
Conservation project. If you can fulfil more than one condition, you choose which. Then, activate the reward on your Zoo Map next to 
where you took the Player token immediately. If the reward has a purple background you will ALSO receive this reward each Break. 
Association Side II: Perform one or more different association tasks. And then, you may also make one donation. You may do several 
different Association Tasks for your action, but you must spend Association Workers for each task you do. The total strength of the 
Association Tasks you do must not exceed the action strength. 
If you do the task ‘Conservation Project Work’, the card you play may come from your hand or from the display (up to your reputation 
range). However, if you take the card from the display you must also pay money equal to the card’s folder number. The display is not 
refilled until the end of your turn. 
In addition to doing Association Tasks, you may also make exactly one donation. Pay the smallest amount of money visible in the donation 
area, cover the space with a player cube from your general supply (not from your Zoo Map), and gain 1 Conservation Point. If all spaces 
except the last are covered, you pay 12 Money for 1 Conservation point, but no cube is placed. You cannot donate if you did not do an 
Association Task in the same action. You do not need an association worker to make a donation. 
Action 5: Sponsors 
Sponsors Side I: Play exactly 1 Sponsor Card, or, Advance the Break Token and take [1x Strength] money. 
The sponsor card you play must not exceed the strength of Sponsor Action you are taking. Also ensure you fulfil any additional 
requirements of the Sponsor Card (depicted on its left bar). Place it next to your Zoo Map. Then Resolve its instant effect once, and/or its 
recurring effect when triggered. Alternatively, advance the Break token [Action Strength] steps, and take [Action Strength] money for 
doing so. You still gain [action strength] money, even if the break token reaches the end of its track before it can move all steps. 
Sponsors Side II: Play 1 or more Sponsor Cards, or Advance the Break Token and take money. If you have upgraded Sponsors Action to 
side II, you can play multiple Sponsors Cards with one Action. These cards can come from your Hand or from the Display. If you take a 
card from the display, it must be within reputation range, and pay the folder cost. The cards you play may have a total level of [Action 
Strength +1]. You can use X-Tokens to increase Strength above 5. Resolve the cards sequentially, and then do any ‘after finishing’ actions. 
Alternatively, advance the Break Token [Action Strength] steps, and take [2x Action Strength] money. 
Once you upgrade your Sponsors Action, you are also able to play Sponsors Cards with ‘Side II Sponsors’ as a requirement. 
X-Token Action: If you cannot / do not want to perform any of the 5 Actions, you can take 1 X-marker. You can perform this action using 
any Action card. It is independent of the value of the card’s slot. It doesn’t matter whether the Action card has been upgraded. You must 
still select an Action card, move it to slot 1, and shift the intervening cards to the right. Then, take an X-token. If you already have 5X-
tokens, you cannot perform this action. 
Appeal/Conservation Points: During the game you increase the appeal of your zoo and collect conservation points. This is necessary to 
win, plus the appeal of your zoo determines how much money you earn each break. Note that spaces 2, 5, and 8 give additional bonuses 
when you reach or pass them. 
Breaks: If a player causes the Break Token to reach the end of its track during their turn, a Break is resolved immediately after the player 
concludes their turn. Then all players resolve the following steps in order: 
Hand Card Limit: All players must discard to their hand card limit (3 cards as normal, or 5 if certain University Tile taken). 
Tokens on Action Cards: Multiplier, Venom and/or Constriction Cards on Action Cards are returned to supply. 
Restock Association Board: Return all Association Workers from the Association Board to their owning players – they are now 
available to use again. Replenish all empty tile spaces of the Association Board with their corresponding tile. 
Refresh Card Display: Discard the Zoo Cards on Folders 1 and 2. Slide the remaining cards left to fill the gaps, and fill the newly 
revealed gaps from the deck. 
Take Income: 
Collect Income according to the Appeal of your Zoo. 
Collect Income from your Kiosks (Gain 1 Money per occupied standard enclosure, Special Enclosure, Pavilion and 
Special Enclosure tile adjacent to each Kiosk. Empty standard enclosures don’t provide income, but empty special 
enclosures do. 
Gain Income from your Zoo Map. Check the icons on the left side of your Zoo map, and collect any uncovered incomes. 
d. 
If players have card effects that let them take cards from the display, do this working from the player that triggered the 
break, clockwise. 
Reset Break Track: Return the break token to the starting space for your player count. 
Game End: If a player’s Conservation Counter and Appeal Counter are ever in the same scoring area, or if they pass one another, the end 
of the game is triggered. 
Scoring area = one space on the Conservation track and the adjacent spaces on the Appeal track. 
The player who triggered the end of the game will complete their turn and all other players will take one more turn before moving on to 
final scoring. If the end of the game is triggered during a break, all players will take one more turn. 
Final Scoring: At the end of the game, you still get points from your Final Scoring card(s), as well as from all your cards with an end-of-
game icon [egg timer]. Remember, if no player reached 10 conservation points, all players should discard one of their Final Scoring cards 
before adding these points to your totals. 
Tally Victory Points as follows. Begin by looking at the scoring area where your Conservation tracker is located. Find the lowest Appeal 
value in that scoring area. This is your Target Number. Compare your Target Number to the value of your Appeal tracker. Subtract your 
Target Number from your Appeal value and the result is your Victory Points. The player with the highest positive Victory Point total 
is the winner. In case of a tie, the tied player who supported the most Conservation Projects wins the game (count how many player tokens 
have been removed from left side of your zoo map). If the score is still a tie, all tied players share the victory

Reputation Track: 
Upgrading your Cards Action to Side II has the benefit of allowing your reputation to continue progressing past 9. 
Whenever you advance your reputation counter to a space with a bonus by it, gain that bonus immediately, once. 
If you reach the end of the reputation track and need to advance, instead gain 1 Appeal per rep. you can’t gain. 
Action 2: Build: Note: First building must be built adjacent to edge of board. All later builds must be adjacent to an existing building. 
Build Side I: Build exactly 1 Building of your choice, with a maximum size of [Action Strength] on your zoo map. Pay 2 Money per 
space covered by the building. 
The size of a Building is the # of spaces it covers. You must pay the Building’s cost before placing it. Cost = size x2. 
Available buildings: Kiosk (size 1), Pavilion (size 1), Standard Enclosures (sizes 1-5), and Petting Zoo (size 3). Your zoo can only 
contain 1 Petting Zoo. Large Bird Aviary and Reptile House not available. 
Enclosures accommodate animals, Kiosks provide income during Break (but can only be placed a minimum of 3 spaces away 
from each other). Each pavilion increases your appeal by 1 (once). 
You may only build on vacant spaces of your zoo map. You can’t build on spade spaces of your map until the ‘Build Action’ is 
upgraded to Side II. 
When you build a Standard Enclosure, place it ‘empty’ side up. Petting Zoos are the same on both sides.

following changes: 
You may now build all types of building including Reptile House and Large Bird Aviary. Each Zoo can only have at most one Large 
Bird Aviary and one Reptile House. Both sides of the tile are identical. 
When you build a Reptile House or Large Bird Aviary, you may immediately, and only once for each building move eligable 
animals from standard enclosures to the new enclosure. Once you have made this transfer, the emptied Standard Enclosures 
flip to their empty side. 
You cannot build unique buildings with this action (they are built using the Sponsor action). 
You cannot build 2 identical buildings using this action. 
Build each building sequentially, paying immediately before building the building. Once all construction is complete, then resolve 
any ‘after finishing’ bonuses. 
Once you have upgraded to Side II, you are permitted to build on the ‘spade’ spaces on your Zoo Map. 
If you cover every space of your Zoo Map with Buildings, immediately increase your Zoos appeal by 7. 
Action 3: Animals 
Animals Side I: Play animal cards from your hand (consult the table on the Action Card, and use the Action’s [strength] to determine how 
many animal cards you may place). Follow these steps for each animal you place: 
Check Conditions: You must ensure that your zoo and intended enclosure meet all conditions specified on the Animal Card you 
with to place. These are listed down the left hand side of the Animal Card. This may include: Adjacency to Rocks or Water, 
Minimum enclosure size, (and whether it can share a Special Enclosure (aviary or reptile house), Science Icons, Zoo Partnerships 
with certain continents, Continent tags etc. The icons in the top right are the icons you gain from placing the Animal. 
Pay Cost: Pay the amount of money specified to the supply. If you have a partner zoo from the continent of origin of the Animal, 
reduce this cost by 3 Money per matching continent icon in the top right of that Animal Card. You must be able to afford the full 
cost of the Animal before placing it. 
Fill Empty Enclosure: To play an animal card you must have an available enclosure of at least the required size. 
You can place any animal (except Petting Zoo animals) into an enclosure provided the enclosure is at least as large as 
the minimum enclosure size requirement of the Animal. Flip the enclosure to its occupied side. 
Some animals have adjacency requirements for their enclosures (near water or rocks) which must be met. 
You can place Petting Zoo animals in the Petting Zoo (never in a standard enclosure). 
Some birds may be accommodated in either a standard enclosure or the large bird aviary (see each card). 
All reptiles may be accommodated in either a standard enclosure, or the reptile house. 
If you want to accommodate an animal in a special enclosure, use player tokens from your supply to mark the number 
of enclosure spaces indicated in the special enclosure icon of that Animal Card. If there is insufficient space to fit the 
animal, it cannot be placed there. Special enclosures never need to be flipped. 
Remember: If you place a bird or reptile in a standard enclosure, and build a bird or reptile house later, immediately 
on building, you may transfer birds/reptiles respectively to the new enclosure. 
Place Animal Card: Place the Animal Card next to your Zoo Map. 
Resolve Effects: Effects are in the text of the card, and in icons at the bottom. 
All animals increase the Appeal of your zoo. Advance your appeal token the indicated number of spaces. 
Some Animals increase the Conservation of your zoo. Advance your Conservation Token as indicated. 
Some Animals increase the Reputation of your zoo. Advance your Reputation Token as indicated. 
Many Animals have additional effects. If the effect is ‘after finishing’ resolve all Animal placements before resolving the 
effect. Otherwise resolve it immediately. 
Also resolve any effects that the placement of the Animal triggers on other cards in your tableau. If there are multiple 
other effects triggered, you choose the order of resolution. 
If you are placing multiple animals, complete one placement before starting the next. 
Animals Side 2: Play Animal Cards from your hand, or directly from the display within reputation range. The action’s Strength is 
compared with the table on the ‘Animals’ Action Card to determine how many animals. 
If you perform this action with a Strength of at least 5, you may increase your Zoo’s reputation by 1. Do this BEFORE playing 
Animals, so you benefit from the increased reputation range. 
If you play an Animal Card from the display, it must be within your reputation range. In addition to normal costs, you must 
pay money equal to the folder number adjacent to the animal. Do not replenish the display until you have finished your turn. 
By upgrading the Animals Action, you may also now play Animals that have Animals Side II as a requirement. 
Action 4: Association 
Association Side I: Do exactly 1 Association Task (from the choices below). 
You must have at least 1 Active Association Worker on your zoo map to do this action. 
If 1 of your Association Workers is already on this task (ie you did it once), instead place 2 to perform this task. 
If 3 of your Association Workers are on this task (i.e. you did it twice) you can’t do this action until after next Break. 
Each Association Task requires a different minimum Action Strength as follows: 
Increase Reputation (Strength 2): Increase the reputation of your Zoo by 2. Gain any bonus shown. The reputation of your Zoo determines 
your reputation range for drawing cards, and certain Sponsor Cards require a min. reputation to play. 
Gain A Partner Zoo (Strength 3): Take an available Partner Zoo token (of a continent you don’t already have), and place it in the lowest 
available Partner Zoo slot on your player board. If the space shows a bonus, gain it once, immediately. You can only gain a maximum of 4 
Partner Zoos out of the 5 available. To take your 3rd or 4th Partner Zoo, you must have upgraded the Association Action to Side II. The 
Partner Zoos available are replenished during Break. Each Partner Zoo you have reduces the cost of playing Animal Cards from its continent 
by 3 money for each continent icon on the Animal Card (top R only). It also provides you with 1 Continent Icon of its respective continent 
which may trigger other card effects or count towards conservation projects. Certain Animal Cards also require a partner zoo from the 
same continent to be played. 
Gain a Partner University (Strength 4): Take a University from the Association board (that you do not already have), and place it on the 
lowest available university space on your Zoo Map. If the space depicts a bonus, gain it immediately, once. Advance your Reputation 
Marker if the University gives you reputation. Universities are replenished during Break. Universities may give you Reputation, Research 
Icons, and increase your hand size to 5. 
Conservation Project Work (Strength 5): You may either: (1) Support a Conservation Project already in play, or, (2) play a new 
Conservation Project from your hand, and support it immediately. 
If you play a new conservation project, place it above the Association Board, in the leftmost space. If there is a conservation project already 
in that space, slide the projects right to make space for it. In a 2/3/4P game there is a limit of 2/3/4 Conservation Projects above the 
Association Board – if this limit is exceeded, the rightmost project is discarded (return any player tokens on it to supply, not the respective 
player’s Zoo Board). 
To support a Conservation project, you must fulfil one of its vacant conditions. You can only support each Conservation Project once. Select 
1 player token from the left side of your Zoo Map, and place it on the condition you fulfil. Gain the reward(s) depicted on the 
Conservation project. If you can fulfil more than one condition, you choose which. Then, activate the reward on your Zoo Map next to 
where you took the Player token immediately. If the reward has a purple background you will ALSO receive this reward each Break. 
Association Side II: Perform one or more different association tasks. And then, you may also make one donation. You may do several 
different Association Tasks for your action, but you must spend Association Workers for each task you do. The total strength of the 
Association Tasks you do must not exceed the action strength. 
If you do the task ‘Conservation Project Work’, the card you play may come from your hand or from the display (up to your reputation 
range). However, if you take the card from the display you must also pay money equal to the card’s folder number. The display is not 
refilled until the end of your turn. 
In addition to doing Association Tasks, you may also make exactly one donation. Pay the smallest amount of money visible in the donation 
area, cover the space with a player cube from your general supply (not from your Zoo Map), and gain 1 Conservation Point. If all spaces 
except the last are covered, you pay 12 Money for 1 Conservation point, but no cube is placed. You cannot donate if you did not do an 
Association Task in the same action. You do not need an association worker to make a donation. 
Action 5: Sponsors 
Sponsors Side I: Play exactly 1 Sponsor Card, or, Advance the Break Token and take [1x Strength] money. 
The sponsor card you play must not exceed the strength of Sponsor Action you are taking. Also ensure you fulfil any additional 
requirements of the Sponsor Card (depicted on its left bar). Place it next to your Zoo Map. Then Resolve its instant effect once, and/or its 
recurring effect when triggered. Alternatively, advance the Break token [Action Strength] steps, and take [Action Strength] money for 
doing so. You still gain [action strength] money, even if the break token reaches the end of its track before it can move all steps. 
Sponsors Side II: Play 1 or more Sponsor Cards, or Advance the Break Token and take money. If you have upgraded Sponsors Action to 
side II, you can play multiple Sponsors Cards with one Action. These cards can come from your Hand or from the Display. If you take a 
card from the display, it must be within reputation range, and pay the folder cost. The cards you play may have a total level of [Action 
Strength +1]. You can use X-Tokens to increase Strength above 5. Resolve the cards sequentially, and then do any ‘after finishing’ actions. 
Alternatively, advance the Break Token [Action Strength] steps, and take [2x Action Strength] money. 
Once you upgrade your Sponsors Action, you are also able to play Sponsors Cards with ‘Side II Sponsors’ as a requirement. 
X-Token Action: If you cannot / do not want to perform any of the 5 Actions, you can take 1 X-marker. You can perform this action using 
any Action card. It is independent of the value of the card’s slot. It doesn’t matter whether the Action card has been upgraded. You must 
still select an Action card, move it to slot 1, and shift the intervening cards to the right. Then, take an X-token. If you already have 5X-
tokens, you cannot perform this action. 
Appeal/Conservation Points: During the game you increase the appeal of your zoo and collect conservation points. This is necessary to 
win, plus the appeal of your zoo determines how much money you earn each break. Note that spaces 2, 5, and 8 give additional bonuses 
when you reach or pass them. 
Breaks: If a player causes the Break Token to reach the end of its track during their turn, a Break is resolved immediately after the player 
concludes their turn. Then all players resolve the following steps in order: 
Hand Card Limit: All players must discard to their hand card limit (3 cards as normal, or 5 if certain University Tile taken). 
Tokens on Action Cards: Multiplier, Venom and/or Constriction Cards on Action Cards are returned to supply. 
Restock Association Board: Return all Association Workers from the Association Board to their owning players – they are now 
available to use again. Replenish all empty tile spaces of the Association Board with their corresponding tile. 
Refresh Card Display: Discard the Zoo Cards on Folders 1 and 2. Slide the remaining cards left to fill the gaps, and fill the newly 
revealed gaps from the deck. 
Take Income: 
Collect Income according to the Appeal of your Zoo. 
Collect Income from your Kiosks (Gain 1 Money per occupied standard enclosure, Special Enclosure, Pavilion and 
Special Enclosure tile adjacent to each Kiosk. Empty standard enclosures don’t provide income, but empty special 
enclosures do. 
Gain Income from your Zoo Map. Check the icons on the left side of your Zoo map, and collect any uncovered incomes. 
d. 
If players have card effects that let them take cards from the display, do this working from the player that triggered the 
break, clockwise. 
Reset Break Track: Return the break token to the starting space for your player count. 
Game End: If a player’s Conservation Counter and Appeal Counter are ever in the same scoring area, or if they pass one another, the end 
of the game is triggered. 
Scoring area = one space on the Conservation track and the adjacent spaces on the Appeal track. 
The player who triggered the end of the game will complete their turn and all other players will take one more turn before moving on to 
final scoring. If the end of the game is triggered during a break, all players will take one more turn. 
Final Scoring: At the end of the game, you still get points from your Final Scoring card(s), as well as from all your cards with an end-of-
game icon [egg timer]. Remember, if no player reached 10 conservation points, all players should discard one of their Final Scoring cards 
before adding these points to your totals. 
Tally Victory Points as follows. Begin by looking at the scoring area where your Conservation tracker is located. Find the lowest Appeal 
value in that scoring area. This is your Target Number. Compare your Target Number to the value of your Appeal tracker. Subtract your 
Target Number from your Appeal value and the result is your Victory Points. The player with the highest positive Victory Point total 
is the winner. In case of a tie, the tied player who supported the most Conservation Projects wins the game (count how many player tokens 
have been removed from left side of your zoo map). If the score is still a tie, all tied players share the victory
