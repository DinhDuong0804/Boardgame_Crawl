    "description": "Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace\u0027s 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution between the years of 1770 and 1870.\n\nIt offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build and establish your industries and network in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.\n\nEach round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):\n\n1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.\n2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.\n3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.\n4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.\n5) Loan - Take a \u0026pound;30 loan and reduce your income.\n\nBrass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:\n\n6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)\n\n",

    "description": "Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts in a very similar fashion as basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hot spots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nDuring a player\u0027s turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.\n\nAfter a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.\n\nEach month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month\u0027s objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.\n\nDuring the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it\u0027s no longer available for play.\n\nPart of the Pandemic series\n\n",

    "description": "Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the roles of wandering adventurers with their own special sets of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.\n This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions about what to do next, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \u0026ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure\u0026rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a co-operative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.\n\nEach turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player\u0026rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end u exhausted and be forced to retreat.\n\n",

    "description": "Dune: Imperium is a game that uses deck building to add a hidden information angle to traditional worker placement. It finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.\n\nAs a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal your forces and spies. War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis \u0026ndash; Dune, the desert planet.\n\nYou start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents.  As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.\n\nUnlike many deck building games, you don\u0026rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it\u0026rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you\u0026rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round\u0026rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.\n\nDefeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards. The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!\n\nSome important links: The Official FAQ, the Unofficial FAQ, and an Automa (solo and 2p) Overview\n\n",

    "description": "Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players each take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.\n\nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed from among 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.\n\nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these strategies are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empires, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.\n\nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them over the course of the game. Each player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, achievement of which provides victory points--only for the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor\u0027s home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "year": 2011,
    "description": "In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP) while the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions before they start to fight in earnest: this is represented by the Political Track which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.\n\nThe game can be won by a military victory if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ring bearer: while the armies clash across Middle-earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle-earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ring bearer from harm with an attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow so that they do not overrun Middle-earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can perform during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies or characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.\n\n",

    "description": "In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.\n\nAs a player, you acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to your hand. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards and actually playing them. Standard Projects are always available to complement your hand of cards. Your basic income, as well as your basic score, are based on your Terraform Rating. However, your income is boosted by your production, and VPs are also gained from many other sources.\n\nYou keep track of your production and resources on your player board.  The game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation and consists of the following phases:\n\n1) Player order shifts clockwise.\n2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.\n3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.\n4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.\n\nWhen the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their required levels, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Combine your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!\n\n",

    "name": "Star Wars: Rebellion",
    "year": 2016,
    "description": "Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.\n\nExperience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you\u0027ll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:\n\n     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.\n     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you\u0027ll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you\u0027ll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you\u0027ll need to sway the galaxy\u0027s citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.\n\n\nFeaturing more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy\u0027s most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.\n\nYet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!\n\n",

    "year": 2017,
    "description": "In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\n\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic co-operative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit\u0027s elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek new power, or to spread their presence into new areas of the island.\n\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming towns and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you\u0027d hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them, for example, to drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\n\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last explorer, town and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they\u0027ll run away even if explorers or even towns and cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\n\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg., a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.\n\n",

Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?\n\nGloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry \u0026mdash; i.e., learning the game \u0026mdash; has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.\n\n",

As in the original Terra Mystica, fourteen different factions live on seven different kinds of planets, and factions are bound to their own home planets, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring planets into their home environments in competition with the other groups. In addition, Gaia planets can be used by all factions for colonization, and Transdimensional planets can be changed into Gaia planets.\n\nAll factions can improve their skills in six different areas of development: Terraforming, Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, Gaiaforming, Economy, Research; leading to advanced technology and special bonuses. To do all of that, each group has special skills and abilities.\n\nThe playing area is made of ten sectors, allowing a variable set-up and thus an even bigger replay value than its predecessor Terra Mystica. A two-player game is hosted on seven sectors.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are \u0026ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle. \u0026ndash; John F. Kennedy\n\nIn 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler\u0027s war machine, while humanity\u0027s most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors.\n\nTwilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new \u0022superpowers\u0022 scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.\n\nTwilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT\u0027s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one\u0027s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.\n\nTIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn\nMAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system\nUNIT SCALE:     Influence markers\n\n",

While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers. The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.\n\nThe game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.\n\nDuring each round, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:\n\n    take a settlement tile and place it in the staging area on their player board\n    take a settlement tile from the staging area and place in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, \n    deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice\n    take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.  \n\n\nIn addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile and place it in the staging area on their player board.\n\nThe game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins.\n\nThe rules include basic and advanced versions.\n\n",

    "description": "Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game\u0027s cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.\n\nThrough the Ages (TTA) is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, and by: discovering new technologies, electing competent leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages, beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is \u0027built\u0027 in the same manner as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with a stronger military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a strong military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n",

This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the \u0022Great Western Trail\u0022 not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.\n\nIf you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, you lead a scientific institution tasked with searching for traces of life beyond planet Earth. The game draws inspiration from current or emerging technologies and efforts in space exploration.Players will explore nearby planets and their moons by launching probes from Earth while taking advantage of ever-shifting planetary positions. Decide whether to land on their surface to collect valuable samples, or stay in orbit for a broader survey. Additionally, by directing your telescopes to gaze into distant star systems, you may detect traces of alien signals or undiscovered exoplanets, and collect promising data to examine and study back home.\n\nBack on Earth, you can invest in upgrading your equipment so you can analyze incoming data more efficiently, boost your telescope signal capacity, or increase your supply of resources\u0026mdash;all to expand the scope of your search that could lead to a discovery of extraterrestrial life forms. Finding traces of extraterrestrial life is only a matter of time \u0026mdash; utilize the resources you have at your disposal strategically and you may well end up being the one to make the biggest scientific contribution towards advancing our understanding of alien life within our galaxy.\n\nYou will also make use of over 200 cards to aid your efforts or focus your research in a particular direction for additional bonuses and rewards. Each card has unique effects and illustrations and depicts real-life technologies, projects, and discoveries (like the ISS, Large Hadron Collider, Perseverance rover, Voyager probe, and many more).\n\nThe game is played in 5 rounds. The player with the starting player marker takes the first turn of the round. Players take turns in clockwise order, skipping any players that have already passed for the round. At the end of round 5, the final score is calculated and the player with the most points wins.\n\nSETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence pays homage to space and planetary exploration, astronomy, the ongoing search for signs of life in the vastness of space, and efforts to understand the nature of life in the universe.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

It\u0027s an outpost barely surviving the harsh weather let alone invasions from forces both known and unknown. However, a group of mercenaries, at the end of their rope, will help bring this settlement back from the edge of destruction. Not only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but with other, far more dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold, as well. There are: Algox, the bigger, more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding in from the northern sea; and rumors have it that there are machines that wander the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.\n\nFrosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign.  Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.\n\nIn addition to using the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven features other elements, such as mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how the ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.\n\nFrosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanism for bringing items over from \u0027Gloomhaven\u0027. However, as Frosthaven\u0027s outpost is a remote location, these products may be imported but are not present as standard items. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buying them.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Brass: Lancashire \u0026mdash; first published as Brass \u0026mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize on demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each phase. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:\n\n\n    Build an industry tile\n    Build a rail or canal\n    Develop an industry\n    Sell cotton\n    Take a loan\n\n\nAt the end of your turn, you replace the two cards you played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, the lowest spender going first. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.\n\nAfter all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed from the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and double-connection builds (though expensive) are possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.\n\nThe cards limit where you can build your industries, sell cotton or build connections (though any card can be used to \u0027develop\u0027). This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if you build a rail line (which requires coal) you have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent\u0027s coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).\n\nBrass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:\n\n\n     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.\n     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.\n     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need of an alternate board.\n     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.\n\n\n",

    "description": "In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders. Over three ages, players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders. What\u0027s different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.\n\nPlayers do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it\u0027s not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.\n\nPlayers can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner\u0027s dominance in this area.\n\nYou can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent\u0027s capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent\u0027s capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n",

    "year": 2016,
    "description": "It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as \u0026ldquo;The Factory\u0026rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.\n\nScythe is an engine-building game set in a 1920s era, alternate-history. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player controls one of five factions of Eastern Europe, all of which are attempting to earn their fortunes and claim their stakes in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.\n\nEach player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.\n\nScythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player\u0026rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \u0026ldquo;encounter\u0026rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engines adds to the unique feel of each game, even if having played one faction multiple times.\n\n",

A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. During the game, you control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. The soldier, on the other hand...\n\nNemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game, you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, agendas held by your fellow players, and sometimes just cruel fate.\n\nThe gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.\n\n",

    "name": "A Feast for Odin",
    "year": 2016,
    "description": "A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game. You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today \u0026mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.\n\nWhen the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.\nIn what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason the people of these times became such strong seafarers was their unfortunate agricultural situation: crop shortfalls caused great distress.\n\nIn this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also engage in the day-to-day activity of collecting goods with which to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.\n\n--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer\u0027s review:\nA Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with a plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risks balanced against rewards. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.\n\nEach year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.\n\nAt the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.\n\nYou will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you\u0026rsquo;re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you\u0026rsquo;re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.\n\nUPC 681706716909\n\n",

    "description": "A dark rumour rises from Mordor. The Eye turns to Middle-earth. The hour has come. The Fellowship is reunited. The Heroes prepare for battle. Will you play as the Fellowship of the Ring to defend the free races and destroy the One Ring? Or will you play as Sauron and pursue Frodo and Sam while deploying your hordes to the gates of the enemy cities? The destiny of Middle-earth is in your hands!\n\nA game plays over 3 successive chapters that unfold similarly.\nOn your turn, strengthen your Skills, hoard your treasure, stretch your presence across Middle-earth, rally Races to your cause, or advance the Quest of the Ring.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTurn OverviewIn each chapter players take cards from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it\u0027s available, that is not partially covered by any other cards. Players can either play the card, paying its cost and placing it in their play area, obtaining its benefit, or discard the card and take as many coins from the reserve as the current chapter.\n\nPlayers can also take a Landmark tile from one of the faceup tiles, paying its cost placing it in their play area. They will be able to immediately place a Fortress pawn on the corresponding region of the central board and benefit from its other effects.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVictory ConditionsImmediately win the game by fulfilling one of the 3 victory conditions:\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuest of the Ring\n     For the Fellowship: If Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom, they destroy the One Ring and you immediately win the game.\n     For Sauron: If the Nazg\u0026ucirc;l catch Frodo and Sam, they seize the One Ring and you immediately win the game.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSupport of the RacesIf any player gathers 6 different Race symbols on their Green cards, they rally the support of the Races of Middle-earth and immediately win the game\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConquering Middle-earthIf a player is present in all 7 regions (with a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit), they dominate Middle-earth and immediately win the game.\n\nIf none of these three victory conditions are achieved by the end of chapter 3, the player who is present in the most regions of Middle-earth (with a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit) wins the game. In case of tie, share the victory.\n\n",

    "description": "Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor \u0026mdash; all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!\n\nConcordia is a peaceful, strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:\n\n\n    They allow a player to choose actions during the game.\n    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. \n\n\nConcordia is a strategy game that requires advanced planning and consideration of your opponent\u0027s moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds their 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.) wins the game.\n\n",

Now you will lead an expedition to explore the island, find lost artifacts, and face fearsome guardians, all in a quest to learn the island\u0027s secrets.\n\nLost Ruins of Arnak combines deck-building and worker placement in a game of exploration, resource management, and discovery. In addition to traditional deck-builder effects, cards can also be used to place workers, and new worker actions become available as players explore the island. Some of these actions require resources instead of workers, so building a solid resource base will be essential. You are limited to only one action per turn, so make your choice carefully... what action will benefit you most now? And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn\u0027t take the action first!?\n\nDecks are small, and randomness in the game is heavily mitigated by the wealth of tactical decisions offered on the game board. With a variety of worker actions, artifacts, and equipment cards, the set-up for each game will be unique, encouraging players to explore new strategies to meet the challenge.\n\nDiscover the Lost Ruins of Arnak!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the \u0022Great Western Trail\u0022 not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.\n\nIf you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.\n\nThe second edition of Great Western Trail includes solitaire rules, making for a player count of 1-4.\n\nSecond Edition:\nRemember the old days in the West? Well, the times they are a-changing\u0026rsquo;! From new solo opponent to incredible landscapes, you won\u0027t know where to start. And there is a new herd of cows for you to sell!\n\nGreat Western Trail is the critically acclaimed game of cattle ranching by Alexander Pfister. Players attempt to wrangle their herd across the Midwest prairie and deliver it to Kansas City. But beware! Other cowboys are sharing the trail with you. We invite you to saddle up!\n\nThe changes in the Second edition:\n\n\n     Brand New Artwork by Chris Quilliams\n     Solo Mode: A New Challenger in the West\n     Dual-Layered Player Boards\n     Addition of a new breed of cows: The Simmental breed\n     Two new reversible buildings (#11 \u0026 12)\n     Twelve Exchange Tokens, First introduced in the Rails of North Expansion, for more interaction with other players\n     Four new Master Tiles added for more strategy, replayability, and challenges\n\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!\n\nIn the game, you, alone or with a friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets), become investigators within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you\u0027ve dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you\u0027ll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.\n\nNo matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you\u0027ll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world\u0027s most terrifying mysteries.\n\nEach of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You\u0027ll find cultists and foul rituals. You\u0027ll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...\n\nThe basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham\u0027s landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand\u0026mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.\n\n",

Your goal is to work together as a team to land your airplane in different airports around the world.\n\nTo land your plane, you need to silently assign your dice to the correct spaces in your cockpit to balance the axis of your plane, control its speed, deploy the flaps, extend the landing gear, contact the control tower to clear your path, and even have a little coffee to improve your concentration enough to change the value of your dice.\n\nIf the aircraft tilts too much and stalls, overshoots the airport, or collides with another aircraft, you lose the game...and your pilot\u0027s license...and probably your life.\n\nFrom Montreal to Tokyo, each airport offers its own set of challenges. Watch out for the turbulence as this could end up being a bumpy ride!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.\n\nThe nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u0026rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.\n\nIn Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each group is bound to its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups.\n\nTerra Mystica is a full information game, without any luck, that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group\u0027s skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.\n\nTaking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group\u0027s special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:\n\n\n    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)\n    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)\n    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)\n    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)\n    Forest (Witches, Auren)\n    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)\n    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)\n\n\nProximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficult...\n\nTerra Mystica FAQ\n\n",

Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous \u0022baddie\u0022 responsible.\n\nTeam up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100\u002B unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle.\n\n",

The working class faces a dismantled welfare system, the capitalists are losing their hard-earned profits, the middle class is gradually fading and the state is sinking into a deep deficit. Amidst all this chaos, the only person who can provide guidance is... you. Will you take the side of the working class and fight for social reforms? Or will you stand with the corporations and the free market? Will you help the government try to keep it all together, or will you try to enforce your agenda no matter the cost to the country?\n\nHegemony is an asymmetric politico-economic card-driven board game for 2-4 players that puts you in the role of one of the socio-economic groups in a fictional state: The Working Class, the Middle Class, the Capitalist Class and the State itself.\n\nThe Working class controls the workers. The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist\u0027s companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.\n\nWhile players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important. Through careful planning, strategic actions and political maneuvering, you will do your best to increase the power of your class and carry out your agenda. Will you be the one to lead your class to victory?\n\nHegemony is heavily based on actual academic principles such as Social-Democracy, Neoliberalism, Nationalism and Globalism, and allows players to see their real world applications through engaging gameplay. There are many ways to achieve hegemony- which one will you take?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host\u0026mdash;you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?\n\nEverdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.\n\nOn their turn a player can take one of three actions:\n\na) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player\u0027s tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\n\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\n\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.\n\n",

As members of a deep-sea expedition, you and your fellow crew are on a quest to locate the lost continent of Mu\u0026mdash;but your success depends on precision, teamwork, and a shared sense of timing.\n\nEach mission presents a new puzzle made up of unique tasks: perhaps one player must win a specific card, while another must avoid it entirely. The trick? You\u0026rsquo;ll have to complete these challenges through standard trick-taking rules\u0026mdash;like in traditional card games\u0026mdash;but with extremely limited communication. Each round becomes a tightrope walk of strategic cardplay and silent coordination.\n\nBuilding on the acclaimed system of The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine, this sequel introduces a more dynamic mission system with variable difficulty levels, a fresh deck of task cards, and improved scalability for different player counts. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re playing as a duo or a full five-person team, every game unfolds as a tightly wound tactical dance through the depths.\n\nWith 32 increasingly challenging missions and countless combinations of tasks, The Crew: Mission Deep Sea offers a replayable and rewarding dive into the unknown\u0026mdash;perfect for those who love trick-taking games with a twist of cooperation and pressure.\n\n",

    "description": "In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meagre vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n\nThe players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There\u0027s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n\nFortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful. Using those workers and visitors, the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders, working towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.\n\nViticulture Essential Edition includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from the original Tuscany expansion, including Mamas \u0026 Papas, Fields (previously known as Properties), expanded and revised Visitors, and Automa cards for a solo variant, along with a few minor rule changes.\n\n",

    "description": "Crokinole is a traditional two- or four-player dexterity game, played on a circular wooden board, with 3 rings and an inner recessed \u0027bullseye\u0027. A ring of posts is set around the inner circle, which functions as an obstacle to reach this area. Playing pieces are wooden circular disks similar to checkers pieces.  Players take turns shooting disks across the board by flicking them with their fingers in an effort to land them in the highest scoring ring on the board, the highest score (20 points) achieved by shooting a disk into the centre, recessed hole. From the outside in, rings are worth 5, 10, 15 points.\n\nAs a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association\u0027s rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.\n\nEach disk to be shot must be placed on the outer boundary and within the shooting player\u0027s quadrant. If there are no opponent\u0027s disks on the board, the shot disk must land in the inner ring or it is removed. If there is an opponent\u0027s disk on the board, the shot disk must hit an opponent\u0027s piece, either directly, or by bumping another disk into it.  Disks landing in the centre hole are removed and scored at the end of the round. Disks that lie outside--or are touching--the outer boundary after each shot are removed from play for the round.\n\nThe player to score the most points wins the round and scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A \u0022game\u0022 is usually played to four rounds. The number of \u0022games\u0022 in a match is set by the tournament.\n\nAlternatively, play is to a set score, usually the first player or team to 100, and each round is scored by cancellation. For example if Player One scores 250, and Player Two scores 225, then Player One will add 25 to his/her game score.\n\n",

    "description": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have become more common since 2014 and are the future of the automobile industry. They are superior vehicles due to them being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and cheaper to run. They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion-engine counterparts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them.\n\nYou will be overseeing the production of these vehicles in Kanban EV, with \u0022kanban\u0022 (\u770B\u677F) being the name for a scheduling system that supports an efficient assembly line, just-in-time production, and a smooth workflow process. Over the course of the game, players take on the role of rookie employees who are trying to secure their career. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve and innovate automobile parts, and get your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production and impress the factory manager.\n\nYou must make shrewd use of the recycling facilities and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate parts when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn\u0027t wait for you or for mistakes. Sandra, the factory manager, will review your performance and keep the factory on tempo.\n\nKanban EV is a game that focuses on resource and time management that puts you in the driver\u0027s seat of an entire production facility, racing for factory goals and the highest level of promotion. You earn production points (PP) for performing various actions in the game, and the player with the most PP at the end of the game wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from publisher\n\nIncludes solo mode by D\u0026aacute;vid Turczi\n\n",

Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player\u0027s \u0022A-cards\u0022; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.\n\nAll of the nearly 220 cards \u0026mdash; whether special or basic \u0026mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use. Underwater areas are planned to be double-sided, giving players many opportunities to achieve VPs and finally win.\n\n",

We are the Home of the Original Burger, not a hippie health haven. And place a billboard next to that new house on the corner. I want them craving beer every second they sit in their posh new garden.\u0022 The new management trainee trembles in front of the CEO and tries to politely point out that... \u0022How do you mean, we don\u0027t have enough staff? The HR director reports to you. Hire more people! Train them! But whatever you do, don\u0027t pay them any real wages. I did not go into business to become poor. And fire that discount manager, she is only costing me money. From now on, we\u0027ll sell gourmet burgers. Same crap, double the price.

    "year": 2019,
    "description": "In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period \u0022The Great Game\u0022 because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.\n\nIn terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game\u0027s map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.\n\nTo survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a \u0022Dominance Check\u0022, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.\n\nAfter each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.\n\n",

Lovecraft, you and your fellow players represent investigators in the 1920s who instead of trying to stop the coming of Elder Gods, want to summon those otherworldly beings so that you can put a stop to them permanently. You start the game insane, and while your long-term goal is to shoot Cthulhu in the face, so to speak, at some point during the game you\u0027ll probably fail to mitigate your dice rolls properly and your insanity will cause you to do something terrible \u0026mdash; or maybe advantageous. Hard to know for sure.\n\nThe game has multiple episodes, and each of them has a similar structure of two acts, those being before and after you summon whatever it is you happen to be summoning. If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win.\n\nThe episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.\n\n",

    "name": "Puerto Rico",
    "year": 2002,
    "description": "In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.\n\nEach player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.\n\nThe resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.\n\nDuring each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \u0022Trader\u0022 or \u0022Builder\u0022). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \u0022Builder\u0022 role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.\n\nPuerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \u0022governor\u0022 token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.\n\nPlayers earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \u0022large buildings.\u0022 Each player\u0027s accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.\n\nIn 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I \u0026ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II \u0026ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.\n\n",

    "description": "Following the success of unmanned rover missions, the United Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars Exploration (D.O.M.E.). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment of Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony. As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company\u0026rsquo;s private agenda.  In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet\u0027s surface. As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food \u0026mdash; the necessities for survival. Do you dare take part in humankind\u0026rsquo;s biggest challenge?\n\nOn Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase \u200Band the Shuttle Phase\u200B.\n\nDuring the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet\u0026rsquo;s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.\n\nAll buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony\u0026rsquo;s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.\n\nDuring the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.\n\n",

    "description": "Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that\u0027s paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what\u0027s available \u0026mdash; unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.\n\nIdeally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game\u0027s end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player\u0027s. At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife. Maybe hawks want to be separate from other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears want to be in pairs. Can you make it happen?\n\n",

    "description": "1962 \u0026mdash; The Cold War continues as a new threat looms on the horizon, a deadly new Soviet bioweapon, something called \u0022Project MEDUSA\u0022. You and your fellow medical graduates have been recruited by the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to neutralize enemy agents, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.\n\nCombatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it\u0027s not the only threat you\u0027ll encounter in the field. Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it\u0027s critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won\u0027t be without backup. Coordinate with other covert operatives for assistance and make strategic use of these teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.\n\nDesigned as a prequel, Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 does not require you to have completed Season 1 and Season 2 before diving into this Cold War spy thriller. As in the first two Pandemic Legacy games, each time you play brings new cards, rules, and conditions that affect future games. Each alias you create will gain contacts and other assets to execute your plans more smoothly. And, of course, the CIA will be watching and evaluating your performance in the field. Work together with your fellow agents to prevent this new bio-threat \u0026mdash; the fate of the world depends on it. Can you save humanity once again?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.\n\nIt\u0027s up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.\n\nYou can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.\n\nCaverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.\n\n",

    "description": "It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.\n\nBy powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...\n\nAnachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them \u0026mdash; and both are in short supply.\n\nThe game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs \u0026mdash; unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past \u0022self\u0022 with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths\u0027 settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...\n\n",

    "description": "\u0022Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL\u0022\n\nIn Blood Rage, players control the warriors, leader, and ship of their own Viking clan. Ragnar\u0026ouml;k has come and it\u0026rsquo;s the end of the world! It\u0026rsquo;s the Vikings\u0026rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their places in Valhalla at Odin\u0026rsquo;s side! As a Viking you can pursue one of many pathways to glory. You can: invade and pillage the land for its rewards; crush your opponents in battle: fulfill quests: increase your clan\u0027s stats: or even die gloriously in battle or from Ragnar\u0026ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.\n\nMost player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \u0026ldquo;Gods\u0026rsquo; Gifts\u0026rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having many of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle. Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises. Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles or punishes the winner.\n\nPlayers must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents\u0026rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent\u0026rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!\n\n",

    "description": "In Harmonies, build landscapes by placing colored tokens and create habitats for your animals. To earn the most points and win the game, incorporate the habitats in your landscapes wisely and have as many animals as you can settle there.\n\nStarting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player will choose a set of 3 terrain tokens from the central area to place on their personal board. They may optionally choose an Animal card from the 5 displayed and/or place an Animal cube from their Animal card(s) on any completed patterns on their board that match their personal Animal cards. There is a 4-card limit per player. After their turn, refill with a new set of 3 tokens and a new Animal card if needed.\n\nPlacement of the terrain tokens will depend on the personal Animal card goals, and scoring rules for the various terrain types (mountain, field, forest, etc). For example, mountain tiles score based on how high they are (1 tile scores 1, while 3 tiles stacked score 7), but the mountain scores zero if it is not adjacent to at least one other mountain. If all the cubes on a given Animal card have been placed, the card is set aside and a new card can be drawn. The cards are scored at game end based on the highest number that isn\u0027t covered by a cube.\n\nThe games ends when there are no tokens left in the bag to refill the central area, or at least one players has 2 or fewer empty spaces on their player board. Play continues until all players have had an equal turn that round. The player with the highest points is the winner.\n\nOptionally, you can use Nature\u0027s Spirit cards for richer gameplay. During setup, each player chooses 1 of 2 spirit cards and places a Spirit cube on the card. They follow the same placement rules as Animal cards, but tend to have an ongoing effect once completed. The spirit card does count towards the 4-card hand limit.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In Agricola, you\u0027re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. At first, on a turn, your family gets to take only two actions, one for you and one for your spouse, as might be found among all the possibilities on a farm: plowing fields; collecting materials; building fences, and so on. There are numerous choices available, and while the game progresses you\u0027ll have more and more, as each round a new action card is flipped over, offering one more possible action. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished but first you\u0027ll need to expand your house to make room - and what are you going to feed all the little rug rats?\n\nThe game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the distribution of cards which represent Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner\u0027s version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release) these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist. Each player starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit into his/her strategy.\n\nAgricola is a turn-based game, and the problem to be overcome is that each available action can be taken by only one player each round so it\u0027s important to be careful about your choices.  There are countless strategies, some of which depend on your hand of cards.\n\nThe winner is the player with the most Victory Points from the Improvements made on his farm.\n\n-description originally from BoardgameNews\n\n",

Your goal is to improve your estate so as to be in better standing with the truly influential families in Derbyshire.\n\nObsession is a game of 16 to 20 turns in which players build a deck of Victorian gentry (British social upper class), renovate their estate by acquiring building tiles from a centralized builders\u0027 market, and manipulate an extensive service staff of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and footmen utilizing a novel worker placement mechanic. Successfully hosting prestigious social activities such as Fox Hunts, Music Recitals, Billiards, Political Debates, and Grand Balls increases a player\u0027s wealth, reputation, and connections among the elite.\n\nEach turn, players choose a building tile representing a room or outdoor space in and around their 19th century British country house. The tile chosen dictates the event that can be hosted and the guests to be invited. Players must carefully plan, however, to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed. The reward for success is new investment opportunities, permitting further renovation of the estate (acquisition of more valuable/powerful building tiles), an increase in reputation in the county, an expanding circle of influential acquaintances, and a larger and highly-trained domestic staff.\n\nThroughout the game, a competitive courtship for the hand of the most eligible young gentleman and lady in the county presents specific renovation and reputation objectives. The player who best meets these objectives while accumulating victory points will win the hand of the wealthy love interest and the game.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In the thick of the Viennese modern age, exquisite caf\u0026eacute;s are competing for customers. Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf\u0026eacute; into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor\u0027s favor. Only then will your caf\u0026eacute; become the Grand Austria Hotel.\n\nThe start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.\n\nBut no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.\n\nWith 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value. Each game stands on its own and demands new tactics and strategies.\n\n",

    "description": "Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of Lisboa after the great earthquake of 1755.\n\nOn November 1, 1755, Lisbon suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5\u0026ndash;9.0, followed by a tsunami and three days of fires. The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal \u0026mdash; Sebasti\u0026atilde;o Jos\u0026eacute; de Carvalho e Melo \u0026mdash; was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.\n\nLisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon. During the planning of the downtown project, the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined. The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game, making each game a totally different experience. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and whoever gathers the most wigs by the end of the game wins.\n\nLisboa is played in rounds. Each round, all players play one turn. They may place one card on their display or replace one card from this display. During the game, players schedule hearings to get character favors, such as commerce, construction, and openings. The iconic buildings score the stores and stores provide income to the players. Players need to manage influence, construction licenses, store permits, church power, workers and money, with the workers\u0027 cost being dependent on the prestige of the players.\n\n",

The gods have brought you here, and you must wake them if you wish to return home.\u0022\n\nIn Sleeping Gods, you and up to 3 friends become Captain Sofi Odessa and her crew, lost in a strange world in 1929 on your steamship, the Manticore. You must work together to survive, exploring exotic islands, meeting new characters, and seeking out the totems of the gods so that you can return home.\n\nSleeping Gods is a campaign game. Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with friends throughout your campaign. It\u0027s easy to swap players in and out at will. Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you\u0027ll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way.\n\nSleeping Gods is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.\n\nSleeping Gods is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters.

It wasn\u0027t good enough.\n\nFor three generations, we, the last fragments of humanity have lived on the seas, on floating stations called \u0022havens.\u0022 Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely.\n\nWe\u0027ve managed to keep a network of the largest known cities in the world alive. Things have been tough the past few years. Cities far away from the havens have fallen off our grid...\n\nTomorrow, a small group of us head out into what\u0027s left of the world.

Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.\n\nDuring a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker.

There are many paths to victory. Pleasing the gods by placing crystal skulls in deep caves or building many temples are just two of those many paths...\n\n",

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.\n\nThe objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone\u0027s network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.\n\nHowever, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you\u0027re potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nAdditionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the \u0027renewable\u0027 windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\n\u261B Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

    "description": "In the quiet village of Ravenswood Bluff, \u0026zwnj;a demon walks amongst you. During a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight, there echoes a bone-chilling scream. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the town storyteller murdered, their body impaled on the hands of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in time to execute the true demon and save themselves? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful village?\n\nBlood on the Clocktower is a bluffing game with players on opposing teams of Good and Evil, overseen by a Storyteller player who conducts the action and makes crucial decisions. The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.\n\nDuring a \u0027day\u0027 phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player\u0027s execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. During a \u0027night\u0027 time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.\n\nThe Storyteller uses the game\u0027s intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave. If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it\u0027s started as a powerful Traveller character with unusual talents and questionable allegiances. Each character comes with their own special ability and no two players in a game are ever the same character.\n\n",

    "description": "Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.\n\nPlayers represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!\n\nThe game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:\n\n\n     Players\u0027 turns\n     Production phase\n     Round scoring\n\n\n1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions, from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting. When players run out of money, they pass and collect a passing bonus.\n\n2. In the production phase, each player collects basic resources, refined goods and cash from their production units built on the game map. Each production unit built makes income visible on the player mat. Refined goods require the respective basic resource.\n\n3. Players receive VPs depending on the scoring tile of the current round.\n\nThe game comes with eight different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, eight port bonuses and eight round scoring tiles.\n\n",

    "name": "The White Castle",
    "year": 2023,
    "description": "The heron flies over the Himeji sky while the Daimyo, from the top of the castle, watches his servants move. Gardeners tend the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls, and courtiers crowd the gates, pining for an audience that brings them closer to the innermost circles of the court. When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.\n\nIn The White Castle, players will control one of these clans in order to score more victory points than the rest. To do so, they must amass influence in the court, manage resources boldly, and place their workers in the right place at the right time. The authors are Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero, the duo known as Llama Dice who also designed the successful The Red Cathedral with Devir. In this case, we leave the Moscow of Ivan the Terrible behind to explore the most imposing fortress in modern Japan, Himeji Castle, where the banner of the Sakai clan flies under the orders of Daimyo Sakai Tadakiyo.\n\nThe White Castle is a Euro type game with mechanics of resource management, worker placement and dice placement to carry out actions. During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.\n\nThe central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimyo to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.\n\nWith accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups. As is tradition with Llama Dice titles, its sleek and simple design belies a great deal of strategic depth within the grasp of players.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!\n\nEach player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips from their bags and add them to their pots. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the pot\u0027s swirling pattern, increasing how much the potion will be worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot will explode!\n\nAt the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients, depending on how well they managed to fill up their pots. But players whose pots have exploded must choose points or coins \u0026mdash; not both! The player with the most victory points at the end of nine rounds wins the game.\n\n",

Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.\n\nThe aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game\u0027s end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.\n\nAfter every seven turns, the round ends: players\u0027 cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to New Angeles, home of the Beanstalk. From our branch offices in this monument of human achievement, NBN proudly broadcasts all your favorite media programming. We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee, news and sitcoms, classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that\u0027s fit to view.\n\nAndroid: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.\n\nCorporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with \u0022ice\u0022. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation\u0027s virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.\n\nIn turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It\u0027s not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort\u0027s defenses, there\u0027s no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.\n\nThe first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.\n\nThe Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new.\n\n",

    "description": "Kia ora, and welcome to Great Western Trail New Zealand!\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, you established yourself as a runholder (owner of a sheep station) on the South Island of New Zealand. Recent years have seen your family farm prosper by diversifying your breeds of sheep and increasing the value of your wool.\n\nWith the dawn of the new century, difficult challenges have arisen. You must acquire improved and valuable breeds of sheep to ensure the prosperity of your family business and the labourers who work for you. Decide whether to focus on your past strengths or to diversify into new ventures. Will the beginning of the 20th century be as rewarding as earlier years, or will the efforts of others surpass your strategy? Good luck, and kia kaha!\n\nIn Great Western Trail New Zealand, you move your runholder along a trail that winds and forks from the lower left corner of the game board to Wellington in the upper right. Along your path, you perform actions that provide you with various ways to earn victory points.\n\nEach time your runholder reaches Wellington, you deliver sheep to a local or foreign trading post, which may also be worth victory points. Afterwards, your runholder continues its movement again.\n\n",

    "description": "Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!\n\nImperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire\u0026rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.\n\nIn the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire\u0026rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.\n\nImperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You\u0026rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you\u0026rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.\n\nAs an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.\n\nWith these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you\u0027ll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.\n\n",

There, you will gather repertoires and expand your knowledge of the natural sciences. Your eyes will learn how to detect the hidden species in the tropical forest, gazing at the countless colors and textures of nature. After inspiring hours spent studying and getting to enlightening conclusions, you will rest under a sparkling sky, admiring the stunning complexity of the animal realm.\n\nDarwin\u0027s Journey is a worker-placement Eurogame in which players recall Charles Darwin\u0027s memories of his adventure through the Galapagos islands, which contributed to the development of his theory of evolution.\n\nWith the game\u0027s innovative worker progression system, each worker will have to study the disciplines that are a prerequisite to perform several actions in the game, such as exploration, correspondence, gathering, and dispatch of repertoires found on the island to museums in order to contribute to the human knowledge of biology. The game lasts five rounds, and thanks to several short- and long-term objectives, every action you take will grant victory points in different ways.\n\n",

    "description": "Kingdom Death: Monster is a fully cooperative tabletop hobby game experience.  Set in a unique nightmarish world devoid of most natural resources, you control a settlement at the dawn of its existence. Fight monsters, craft weapons and gear, and develop your settlement to ensure your survival from generation to generation.\n\nCampaign System\nEmbark alone or with up to 3 friends (5 with game variant) on a 5-30-lantern-year campaign, with each year consisting of a cycle of hunt, showdown, and settlement phases. The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival.  During the hunt, you\u0027ll encounter a series of stories in a \u0022choose your own adventure\u0022 style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you\u0027re pursuing, you\u0027ll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.  If your party lives, you\u0027ll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.\n\nMonster AI System\nEach of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it\u0027s HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.\n\nGear System\nIn Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.\n\nStory Event System\n40\u002B Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign.  Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make.\n\nStory Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story. Some are triggered directly from the timeline and others from choices you make in game.\n\n",

Build factories with powerful machines. And populate ancient sites to relearn your tribe\u0027s forgotten technologies.\n--\nRevive is a game for 1-4 players with asymmetric player powers, highly variable setup, and no fighting or direct conflict. Playing through the 5-part campaign unlocks additional contents, and once all contents have been unlocked, the game can be replayed indefinitely.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player gets a set of citizen cards, a tribe board, as well as a huge dual-layer player board. The tribe board shows your unique tribe ability and the ancient technologies that you may relearn during the game. The dual-layer player board is where you place your custom machines and upgrade your card slots.\n\nA main goal of the game is to reach and populate the large ancient sites. These ancient locations are randomized, and as they are important sources of victory points, they will shape your strategy differently each game. The game ends when all artifacts have been taken, and the player with the most points wins.\n\nOn your turn you take two actions: \n\n     Play a card (its effect is determined by which card slot you use)\n     Explore (reveal an area tile and recruit a new citizen card)\n     Populate (populate an ancient location to learn a new technology)\n     Build factory (the adjacent terrains determine which machine tracks you advance)\n\n\n",

    "description": "For centuries, the Novarchs, descendants of the royal House of Novarchon, have ruled with an iron fist over the feudalistic galactic empire of humankind, the Domineum. During this time, they brought stunning technological innovation and scientific advancements to their domain. This accelerated progression helped the Domineum reach \u0026mdash; and eventually inhabit \u0026mdash; even the farthest segments of the known galaxy, where new Houses emerged to govern the outer sectors of the empire. As the House of Novarchon grew in power, so grew the religious cult that surrounded them, proclaiming grim prophecies about an ancient cosmic being from another dimension: the Voidborn.\n\nMany thought it to be only a myth, but in truth, it was the Voidborn\u0027s dark influence that granted the Novarchs the sheer knowledge to achieve rapid expansion for the empire. While the cult of the Novarchs envisaged eternal life through the otherworldly entity, the Voidborn\u0027s only intention was satiating its eternal hunger. And so, when the Domineum had achieved a vastness fitting the Voidborn\u0027s craving, interdimensional rifts opened at the heart of the Domineum to unleash cosmic corruption. As the House of Novarchon and its followers welcomed the Voidborn and sought their false salvation, the entity infected and spread and seized control over the inner worlds. Now, it is time for the remaining Great Houses to purge the galactic corruption, prevent the Voidborn from fully manifesting in our dimension, and to ultimately overcome the chaos as the new rulers of the Domineum.\n\nVoidfall is a space 4X game that brings the genre to Euro enthusiasts\u0027 tables. It combines the tension, player interaction, and deep empire customization of the 4X genre with the resource management, tight decisions, and minimum-luck gameplay of an economic Euro. Win by pushing back the Voidborn in the solo/coop mode, or by overcoming your rivals\u0027 influence in restoring the Domineum in the competitive mode \u0026mdash; both using the same rule set and game system. Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.\n\nAs the leader of a defiant Great House, you play through three cycles, each with a game-altering galactic event, a new scoring condition, and a set number of focus cards that can be played. Focus card decisions and sequencing is the centerpiece of the gameplay. By selecting two of their three impactful actions as you play them, you develop and improve techs; advance on your three house-specific civilization tracks; manage your sectors\u0027 infrastructure, population, and production; and conquer new sectors with up to five different types of space fleets. Space battles are fought either against the Voidborn\u0027s infected forces (which are present as neutral opponents even in the competitive mode) or against other players. Instead of relying on the luck of a die roll, battles in Voidfall are fully deterministic and reward careful preparation and outsmarting your opponents.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing cards representing worlds or technical and social developments.\n\nEach round, players secretly and simultaneously select an action card corresponding to one phase of a round. These phases let players draw cards, play cards, add goods to worlds, or consume goods for VP chips. Only the phases chosen will occur that round. Every player may act in a phase that occurs, but the players who chose that phase get a bonus.\n\nGame end is triggered either when a player has built a civilization of 12 cards or when the pool of VP chips is exhausted. Each player then totals the victory points in their tableau plus any VP chips earned during play.\n\nDetailed Overview\nRace for the Galaxy tells a story of galactic discovery and expansion through a single deck of cards. Every card in the deck represents either a world that you might settle or a development that you might implement. Cards placed into your tableau represent your current achievements -- worlds you have colonized, technology you now wield -- while cards in your hand represent the options currently available to you.\n\nTo play a card, discard the number of cards equal to its cost, representing other opportunities you must forgo to concentrate on your current course. Once in your tableau, a card provides special powers during the game and, at the end, its listed number of victory points. Many worlds, once placed, also produce goods that can be traded for more cards or consumed for VP chips.\n\nRace for the Galaxy is played in rounds. In each round, you and your opponents secretly select an action phase for the upcoming turn. You can choose to:\n\u0026bull; Place a world in your tableau with settle or a development with develop.\n\u0026bull; Produce goods on worlds with produce.\n\u0026bull; Consume goods for VPs with consume.\n\u0026bull; Add cards to your hand with explore or by trading a good.\n\nEach round, only those phases that are selected will occur -- but they\u0027ll occur for everyone. Selecting a phase both ensures that it occurs that round and gains the selecting player a bonus.\n\nRound follows round until someone builds their tableau to twelve cards, or until the last VP chip is claimed. The victor is the player with the most VPs.\n\n2018 UPDATE\nThe second edition of the game is improved for CVD (color blindness) and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.\n\nUPC 655132003018\n\n",

As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.\n\nIn the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they\u0027ve placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player\u0027s score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n",

The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!\n\nDesigned by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard \u0022worker placement\u0022 genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place \u0026ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.\n\nAs befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.\n\n",

Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow. Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!\n\nClank! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you\u0027ll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:\n\n\n    Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.\n    Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.\n    Boots, which are used to move around the board.\n\n\nEvery time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they\u0026rsquo;ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player\u0026rsquo;s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.\n\nDuring the game, you have two goals:\n\n    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.\n    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!\n\n\n",

    "description": "Playing on a famous horror movie trope, Final Girl is a solitaire-only game that puts the player in the shoes of a female protagonist who must kill the slasher if she wants to survive.\n\nThe Core Box, when combined with one of our Feature Film Boxes, has everything you need to play the game. Each Feature Film Box features a unique Killer and and iconic Location, and the more Feature Films you have, the more killer/location combinations you can experience!\n\nIn game terms, Final Girl shares similarities with Hostage Negotiator, but with some key differences that change it up, including a game board to track locations and character movement. You can choose from multiple characters when picking someone to play and multiple killers when picking someone to play against. Killers and locations each have their own specific terror cards that will be shuffled together to create a unique experience with various combinations of scenarios for you to play!\n\nNOTE: The 2022 Kickstarter for Final Girl: Season 2 included a 13 card Final Girl: First Printing Correction Pack of corrected cards for the first printing of Final Girl: Series 1. The cards mostly fix typos and are not required to play the game. The cards were corrected for the second printing of Final Girl: Series 1.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to Arle\nIn Fields of Arle, created by Uwe Rosenberg, one to two players live as farmers in the small and peaceful town of Arle in East Frisia. The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town\u0026rsquo;s prosperity.\n\nWork the Land\nWhether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.\n\nTools of the Trade\nAt the outset of each half year, you\u0026rsquo;ll choose how you\u0026rsquo;d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal, focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock, or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and shear your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals, so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!\n\nTravel and Prosper\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods, it\u0027s time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have, the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game. Build up your farm and your vehicles and get your goods out into the world to make the most of every season. There are many roads to success in Fields of Arle, so pick your path, work the land, and enjoy the friendly competition as you strive to make your fortune!\n\n- from the publisher\u0027s website\n\n",

The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace, and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering, and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy.

    "description": "In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king\u0027s power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\n\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\n\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king\u0027s region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.\n\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.\n\n",

    "description": "SCOUT is a ladder-climbing game in which cards have two potential values, players may not rearrange their hand of cards, and players may pass their turn to take a card from the current high set of cards into their hand.\n\nMore specifically, cards are dual-indexed, with different values on each half of the card, with the 45 cards having all possible combinations of the numbers 1-10. During set-up, whoever is shuffling the cards should randomize both the order of the cards in the deck and their orientation. Once each player has been dealt their entire hand of cards, they pick up that hand without rearranging any of the cards; if they wish, they can rotate their entire hand of cards in order to use the values on the other end of each card, but again they cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hand.\n\nOn a turn, a player takes one of two actions:\n\n\u0026bull; Play: A player chooses one or more adjacent cards in their hand that have all the same value or that have values in consecutive order (whether ascending or descending), then they play this set of cards to the table. They can do this only if the table is empty (as on the first turn) or the set they\u0027re playing is ranked higher than the set currently on the table; a set is higher if it has more cards or has cards of the same value instead of consecutive cards or has a set of the same quantity and type but with higher values. In this latter case when a player overplays another set, the player captures the cards in this previous set and places them face down in front of themselves.\n\n\u0026bull; Scout: A player takes a card from either end of the set currently on the table and places it anywhere they wish in their hand in either orientation. Whoever played this previous set receives a 1 VP token as a reward for playing a set that wasn\u0027t beaten.\n\nOnce per round, a player can scout, then immediately play.\n\nWhen a player has emptied their hand of cards or all but one player have scouted instead of playing, the round ends. Players receive 1 VP for each face-down card, then subtract one point for each card in their hand (except if they were the player scouted repeatedly to end the game). Play as many rounds as the number of players, then whoever has the most points wins.\n\n",

After eight rounds, the player with the most points wins.\n\n",

    "description": "Concordia Venus is a standalone reimplementation of Concordia with some added features.\n\nConcordia Venus is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-6 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:\n\nThey allow a player to choose actions during the game.\nThey are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.\n\nConcordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent\u0027s moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities on the 4 different maps included with the game. When all cards have been sold from the market or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, Venus, etc.) wins the game.\n\n\n     Teams of two players each may play against each other.\n     New personality cards with the goddess Venus allow for new strategies.\n     New maps (Cyprus, Hellas, Ionium) on which to play in addition to the classic Imperium map.\n\n\nNote: This entry is for the standalone game Concordia Venus. This is different from Concordia: Venus (Expansion), which requires Concordia to play.\n\n",

Players represent officials from a distant, decaying and neglectful Empire who are now free to vie for dominance whether through battle, gathering scarce resources or diplomatic intrigue. Ready yourself for dramatic twists and turns as you launch into this galactic struggle.\n\nA deck of cards in 4 suits with ranks from 1-7 (2-6 for fewer than 4 players) defines the action selection system. These cards are played in a trick-taking adjacent system to select actions, take the initiative and declare Ambitions. The 3 declared Ambitions are what will score in that deal. Timing is everything. Bad hands must be mitigated by careful card play and benefitting from other players\u0027 card play.\n\nBattles are resolved quickly with the attacker choosing their level of risk. The defenders must be prepared with adequate defensive ships and cards in their tableau.\n\nEach game contains a hundred wooden ships and agents, 18 custom engraved dice, a beautiful six-panel board, and tons of cards with over 60 pieces of unique art. The base game may be played without the optional Leaders and Lore cards (for an easier teach) or with them for a richer, fuller and asymmetric game. It is also the core of the campaign game (requiring the Blighted Reach Expansion), which provides an epic, more thematic experience.\n\n",

The winner is the faction with the most victory points, which are obtained by researching technologies, improving their economy, controlling and colonizing systems, and completing various achievements and events throughout the game.\n\nOn a turn, a player moves their action pawn to an empty action space, then takes that action. They then conduct their production phase, either producing ore, growing their population, or trading one of those resources for another. Finally, they can claim up to one achievement, if possible.\n\nAs players take actions, they research new technologies that come in four levels. Each technology is one of four types (scientific, economic, military, commercial), and higher-level technologies must match one of the types of tech that lead into it. Thus, players create their own technology tree in each game, using these actions to increase their military strength, to jump to different habitable exoplanetary systems, to colonize those systems, to boost their resource production, to develop android tech that allows growth without population, and more.\n\n",

    "description": "90,000 B.C. \u0026mdash; A great ice age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. \nDominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. \nEach player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes\u0026mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won\u0026rsquo;t last: It is indeed \u0022survival of the fittest\u0022.\nThrough wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. \nAll of this eventually leads to the end game\u0026mdash;the final ascent of the ice age\u0026mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. \nBut somebody better become dominant quickly, because it\u0026rsquo;s getting mighty cold...\n\nGame Play\nThe large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles\u0026mdash;converting them into tundra in the process\u0026mdash;as the ice age encroaches.\nThe cylindrical action pawns (or \u0022AP\u0022s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.\nGenerally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal\u0026rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or \u0022VP\u0022s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.\nThroughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the \u0022earth\u0022). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. \nWhen the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile\u0026mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins.\n\n",

    "description": "At the edge of our solar system, a dark planet may lurk. In 2015, astronomers estimated a large distant planet could explain the unique orbits of dwarf planets and other objects. Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet.\n\nIn The Search for Planet X, players take on the role of astronomers who use observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.\n\nEach round, as the earth travels around the sun, players use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories, which is how players score points.\n\nAs more and more objects are found, players narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.\n\nThe Search for Planet X captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzle-y nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process. Can you be the first to find Planet X?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n",

    "description": "You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.\n\n7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.\n\nIn essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you\u0027ll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you\u0027ve already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.\n\nThough the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3\u0026ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.\n\n",

They\u0027ll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and \u0026ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work \u0026ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game.\n\nIn Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island you will take the role of one of four characters from the ship crew (cook, carpenter, explorer, or soldier) and work cooperatively to build a shelter, palisade, weapons, tools ,etc and do everything you can to survive. You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, and protect yourself from weather changes among other hazards.\n\nSearch for treasures. Discover mysteries. Follow goals of six different, engaging scenarios. Start by building a big pile of wood and setting it on fire to call for help, and then start new adventures.\n\n",

    "description": "Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.\n\nIn more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team\u0027s four words are \u0022pig\u0022, \u0022candy\u0022, \u0022tent\u0022, and \u0022son\u0022, then I might say \u0022Sam-striped-pink\u0022 and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.\n\nStarting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, \u0022sucker-prince-stake\u0022. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they\u0027re correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)\n\nThe rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team\u0027s words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.\n\n",

    "description": "In 1271, 17-year-old Marco Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother. After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the \u0022Silk Road\u0022, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.\n\nIn The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and take turns performing actions by placing their dice onto the board. Players may choose from a variety of actions, each require the use of one or more dice: collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts, traveling on the map or using a special action granted by a city. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.\n\nAfter five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most contracts, and having trading posts in the cities on secret goal cards that each player gets at the start of the game.\n\nThis game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.\n\n",

Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three \u0022epochs\u0022 (rounds).  The game is easy to learn.\n\nFrom the Box:\nThe game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!\nThe players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

    "description": "Trickerion is a competitive Euro-style strategy game set in a fictional world inspired by the late 19th century urban life and culture, spiced with a pinch of supernatural.\n\nPlayers take on the roles of rival stage illusionists, each with their own strengths and characteristics. They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.\n\nUsing worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers \u0026mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices \u0026ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.\n\nThe tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician\u0027s own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.\n\nThe game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.\n\nThe \u0022Dark Alley\u0022 expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game. It also comes with 48 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 27 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.\n\n",

Dark forces work in the shadows and call upon unspeakable horrors, strange happenings are discovered all throughout the city of Arkham, Massachusetts, and behind it all an Ancient One manipulates everything from beyond the veil. It is time to revisit that which started it all\u0026hellip;\n\nIn this game, you, on your own or with a friend (or up to three friends in this revised version), become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham and work to investigate the recent strange happenings and solve the mysteries. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you\u0027ve dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you\u0027ll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.\n\nWith a revamped system of organization and a number of quality-of-life improvements, the box comes with everything you need to get your Arkham campaigns started, including enough cards and components for up to three other players to join you in your quest against the Mythos.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat Has Changed?\n     Support for up to four players with a single core set (the original core set supported only two players, meaning players needed two core sets to play with three or four players)\n     Two copies each of all 96 player cards from the original core set (the original core set included only one copy each of most of the player cards), with several featuring brand-new art, along with two copies each of 13 additional player cards previously released in expansions and not found in the original core set\n     An included cloth Chaos Bag for the chaos tokens (not included in the original core set)\n     New organization within the box\u0027s packaging, making it much easier to find the cards for the player decks and for each scenario than before\n     Additional quality-of-life improvements, such as new \u00223\u0022 and \u00225\u0022 numbered resource and clue/doom tokens and even a lead investigator token\n     Revised \u0022Learn to Play\u0022 rulebook to allow new players to jump into the game more easily\n\n\nThis revised edition is 100% compatible with all material previously published. Players who have all of the content released before this revised starter set will not find any new cards; this set contains the same cards, just more copies of them (and some with new art). \u0022Old-timers\u0022 can continue where they left off under the new two-boxes campaign format (replacing the old \u0022deluxe expansion \u002B mythos packs\u0022 format) starting with Edge of the Earth.\n\n",

    "description": "Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:\n\n\n     Leadership: Be the leader \u0026mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player \u0026mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents\u0027 clans.\n     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.\n     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.\n\n\nAt the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect \u0022epic tales\u0022 cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions. Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, that reduce by one the total for any Victory condition.\n\nCareful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you\u0027ll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.\n\nWhile Inis has \u0022dudes\u0022 that are \u0022on a map\u0022, it\u0027s a beginner\u0027s mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan\u0027s movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan\u0027s people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan\u0027s miniatures representing warriors.

All of them have one goal in mind: Reaching the golden border first and winning all of the riches for themselves. Whoever chooses the best tactics will be rewarded!\n\nEach player starts with a face-down deck of 8 cards\u0026mdash; his or her expedition \u0026mdash;to draw from. You start each turn with 4 cards in your hand. Use expedition cards to move through the jungle or hire more people for your expedition. Each card in your hand can only be used once per turn - to  move or to buy 1 new card.\n\nWhen a player reaches one of the 3 finishing spaces, he moves to El Dorado and this triggers the final round. The other players will now play their final turn. Once the round is completed, the game is over. If the final round ends up with multiple players reaching El Dorado, the player who has collected the most blockades wins the game.\n\n",

Based on the Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.\n\nAfter the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival\u0026hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?\n\nBattlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities.\n\nPlayers then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don\u0027t match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up.\n\nIf players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.\n\n",

Although he started his career as a telegraphist, his role as one of the major players in the rise of the United States\u0026rsquo; steel industry made him one of the richest men in the world and an icon of the American dream.\n\nAndrew Carnegie was also a benefactor and philanthropist; upon his death in 1919, more than $350 million of his wealth was bequeathed to various foundations, with another $30 million going to various charities. His endowments created nearly 2,500 free public libraries that bear his name: the Carnegie Libraries.\n\nDuring the game you will recruit and manage employees, expand your business, invest in real estate, produce and sell goods, and create transport chains across the United States; you may even work with important personalities of the era. Perhaps you will even become an illustrious benefactor who contributes to the greatness of his country through deeds and generosity!\n\nThe game takes place over 20 rounds; players will each have one turn per round. On each turn, the active player will choose one of four actions, which the other players may follow.\n\nThe goal of the game is to build the most prestigious company, as symbolized by victory points.\n\u0026emsp;\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Sometimes at the expense of others.\n\nSome of the new mechanics are: \n\n     Multi-level base with stairs and elevators \n     Advanced computer actions\n     CSS hatch system \n     Power and light on different levels \n     Contingency procedure \n     New characters and alien race\n\n\n",

    "description": "Architects of the West Kingdom is set at the end of the Carolingian Empire, circa 850 AD. As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?\n\nThe aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game\u0027s end. Points are gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop\u0027s cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at game\u0027s end will their virtue be judged. A few underhand deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia\u0027s masterpiece, Tigris \u0026 Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\n\nStarting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris \u0026 Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This \u0022ziggurat expansion\u0022, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\n\nSome versions of Tigris \u0026 Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they\u0027re for 3-4 players. Tigris \u0026 Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia\u0027s tile-laying trilogy.\n\n",

    "description": "Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a \u0022home\u0022 tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player\u0027s own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players\u0027 villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.\n\nIn spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.\n\nKeyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.\n\nKeyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the \u0022Key\u0022 series from R\u0026D Games set in the medieval \u0022Key\u0022 land.\n\n",

The steward smiles at you like he has a secret, or like he thinks you have a secret, or like you think he thinks you have a secret. There are secret plots brewing, you\u0026rsquo;re sure of it. At the very least, there are yours. A passing servant murmurs, \u0026ldquo;The eggs are on the plate.\u0026rdquo; You frantically search your codebook for the translation before realizing he means that breakfast is ready. Excellent.

    "description": "Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon  is an unforgettable, solo or cooperative adventure experience for 1-4 players. Blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology with a unique vision, it allows you to impact the game world in deep and meaningful ways. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike. Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.\n\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by con\uFB02ict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several con\uFB02icting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to di\uFB00erent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\n\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need to brute force your way, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each con\uFB02ict fun and exciting, while keeping you immersed in the game.\n\nIn Avalon, there\u0026rsquo;s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Many secrets can be discovered only after several games. Created by one of the best Polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age. As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it\u0027s raiding season!\n\nTo impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:\n\n\n     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.\n\n\n\n     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement \u0026mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress \u0026mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.\n\n\nThe game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.\n\n",

    "year": 2013,
    "description": "Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?\n\nEldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One \u0026ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.\n\nWhile the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators\u0027 personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.\n\nShould you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition \u0026ndash; or maybe you\u0027ll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a \u0022reckoning effect\u0022 which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.\n\nAll the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they\u0027re certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.\n\nWith twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.\n\n",

    "description": "Once upon a time ...\n1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.\n\nThe players embody master builders. By building the King\u0027s castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King\u0027s favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.\n\nEach turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.\n\nAs new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.\n\n",

To do so, you send your family members to different areas of town, where they can obtain many achievements.

You must choose carefully where to send your most valuable family members...\n\nYou can gain VP in several ways, and you must also pay attention to your relations with the Church. The game is divided into three periods, each formed by two rounds; at the end of each period, players must show their faith, and whoever hasn\u0027t prayed enough will suffer hard penalties.

Alice, Mad Hatter, Red Queen, Jabberwock, and Cheshire Cat must gather all that they can while playing nice at the Hatter\u0027s Tea Party before going to battle!\n\nIn Wonderland\u0027s War, 2-5 players take the role as a faction leader who has been invited to the Hatter\u0027s tea party. Drink tea and eat cake as you move around the table drafting cards to gather your forces, build your towers, upgrade your leader, and recruit Wonderlandians to your cause \u0026mdash; but one must be careful as shards of the Looking Glass are spread throughout Wonderland. Once all the plates are empty, the Tea Party is over and war begins. Use the forces you gathered to battle your enemies in familiar locations, but make sure not to draw your Madness chips or your supporters will abandon your cause and you will be out of the fight. Can you muster enough strength to win the battle, or will you just try to complete Quests instead by meeting the right conditions such as gaining region bonuses and set collection throughout the game?\n\nAfter all the battles have been fought, a truce is called and everyone meets back at the tea party to plot their moves for the next fight. After three rounds, the faction with the most points will be crowned as the new leader of Wonderland!\n\n",

    "description": "In Mombasa, players acquire shares of chartered companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo and spread their trading posts throughout the African continent in order to earn the most money.\n\n\u0022As I expected, the East African Company\u0027s network of trading posts has spread far into the West. They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines. It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town. After all, it can only be to our advantage to have other irons in the fire. And when the day of reckoning comes, it will show whether our hoarding of holdings and our intransigent eagerness are worth it...\u0022\n\nMombasa is a tense Euro-style strategy game set in 19th century Africa in which players invest in four chartered companies. Using influence to help them expand across the continent improves the value of the players\u0027 shares in these companies. Players will also trade in bananas, coffee or cotton, work together with diamond merchants and ensure that the accounts are kept up to date. To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning.\n\nMombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game. Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.\n\nThe game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game. With a variety of paths to victory and double-sided company boards, each game will be a new and different challenge.\n\n",

All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.\n\nBut wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn\u0027t be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother\u0027s side, would be delighted.\u0022\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the back of the box\n\nIn Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \u0022buy\u0022 as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.\n\nDominion is not a Collectible Card Game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play\u0026mdash;leading to immense variety.\n\n\u0026mdash;user summary\n\nPart of the Dominion series.\n\n",

    "description": "In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons \u0026mdash; the currency/points in the game \u0026mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.\n\nOn a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch\u0027s location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You\u0027re free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn\u0027t overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player\u0027s time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent\u0027s time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.\n\nIn addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn \u0022button income\u0022: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.\n\nWhat\u0027s more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.\n\nAdditionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn\u0027t happen in every game.)\n\nWhen a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.\n\n",

    "description": "When Elsa von Fr\u0026uuml;hlingsfeld presented her invention to King Frederik Augustus II of Saxony, people thought it was trickery. She used the recently isolated element Uranium to heat up a jar of water and used the resulting steam to power an engine that kept the Uranium active via a process she called \u0026ldquo;atomization.\u0026rdquo; Her device, the Nucleum, ushered in a new era of energy and prosperity over the next decades. Saxony went from a minor regional power to the hub of European science and engineering. Now, a generation later, factories are still hungry for more power, demanding bigger and more Nucleums to be built, more Uranium imported from the nearby country of Bohemia, and railways and power lines built across the country to carry the tamed power of the atoms to Saxony\u0026rsquo;s great cities. Inventors, engineers, and industrialists flock to the Saxon court, vying to be the leader in this new industrial revolution.\n\nNucleum is a heavy euro board game in which players take role of industrialists trying to succeed during the economic and technological boom of 19th-century Saxony, fueled by the invention and spread of the Nucleum (a nuclear reactor).\n\nPlayers earn victory points by developing their networks, building and powering urban buildings, securing contracts, and meeting milestones (randomized endgame goals). Each player also gets unique asymmetric technologies, giving them special powers when unlocked. Gameplay is continuous; players take turns one after another with no rounds or phases.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture.\n\nThe central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.\n\nAt the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.\n\nWhat are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you \u0026ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.\n\nAll game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.\n\n",

    "description": "Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.\n\nTI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The \u0027designer notes\u0027 in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of CATAN, while the \u0022Command\u0022 system cleverly improves on the \u0027oil\u0027 logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.\n\n\nPart of the Twilight Imperium Series.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shattered Empire\n    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shards of the Throne\n\n\nRe-implemented in:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition\n\n\n",

In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.\n\nThe development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.\n\nThere are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?\n\n\nGame Summary\nEach player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:\n- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.\n- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.\n- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.\n\nThe central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:\n- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces\n- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.\n- earn 2 coins\n- take 2 temporary workers\n- jump ahead in turn order\n- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you\n\nEach round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.\n\nAfter 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!\n\n",

Despite its small size, Portugal is one of the world\u0027s leading wine producers. Over six years of harvests, cultivate your vines, choose the best varieties, hire the best oenologists, take part in trade fairs, and show your opponents you are the best winemaker in the game.\n\nAs winemakers in Portugal, the players develop their vineyards and produce wine to achieve maximum profit. The object of the game is to produce quality wines that can be exchanged for money or victory points.\n\nThe Vinhos Deluxe Edition features new art from Ian O\u0027Toole, all components and improved rules of the original game of Vinhos, and a new simplified version of the game. The board is double-sided and features both versions of the game. Here are the main differences from the first edition of Vinhos:\n\n\n    Double-sided player boards can be used in both game versions\n    A ninth region has been added\n    A new estate has been added\n    The Farmer (a new character) has been added\n    The Fair has been streamlined with new mechanisms\n    18 actions tiles to replace the manager\u0027s actions\n    22 multiplier tiles to final scoring\n    The bank action has been removed\n    The zero initial Vintage tile has been removed\n    The exportation action has been optimized for 2 players\n    A few small rules like the limit on experts was removed and the action replaced for another vineyards action\n    No exceptions on a number of things you can do in your turn, now you can buy, hire, sell, export 1 or 2 things in every action\n    Explanation of gameplay was reduced a lot\n    New solo rules designed for the new game version\n\n\n",

    "description": "The great and forgotten Kami have returned from the underworld, displeased with the affairs of the Empire\u0026rsquo;s present Sh\u014Dgun. At the start of spring in the Great New Year, the Kami have gathered their sacred clans with one quest: reclaim the lands of Nippon and return them to their honorable, spiritual traditions. However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces. Alliances must be forged, betrayal is inevitable, honorable standing rises and falls. Political mandates must be navigated and devastating war must be fought, each won by expert skill and cunning negotiation. And only one may stand victorious at the coming of winter. You, honorable Sh\u014Dgun, lead one of these great clans. Do you have the strength of honor, virtue, and spirit, as well as the mastery of steel necessary to deliver on this ancient promise?\n\nRising  Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan. Each player chooses a Clan and competes to lead theirs to victory by accumulating Victory Points over the course of the Seasons. Each Clan possesses a unique ability and differs in Seasonal Income, Starting Honor Rank, and Home Province.\nOver the course of the game, players will forge and break alliances, choose political actions, worship the gods, customize their clans, and position their figures around Japan. In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world. But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins.\n\nIn Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause. Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.\nVictory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan.\n\nThe game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner. \nEach Season is divided into five phases: \n1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, \n2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, \n3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,\n4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and \n5) Seasonal Cleanup.\n\nAs already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game. Peace falls over the land as it gets covered in white snow, and a new Emperor will rise under the power of the great Kami.\n\n",

As the first company to offer extended-stay space vacations, we are excited to have you working for us! As a supervisor of this company, you\u0026rsquo;ll be expected to not only build these ships and satisfy our guests, but also to help the company thrive by enhancing our company network, inventing new technologies, and growing our workforce.  We are a united company, and you\u0026rsquo;ll often find that what another supervisor does will make your job easier. Let me be clear, though, this is a competition. Our current CEO will be stepping down in three years, and the supervisor who comes out on top will take his place.\n\nOn your turn, you will either place a worker to take two actions in the ever-expanding network, launch a ship and send one of your workers to space as a pilot, or recall all your earthbound workers to collect funding bonuses. Actions include acquiring blueprints, constructing ships, attracting guests, and building developments\u0026ndash;connections between locations that increase action selection throughout the game. You will also be affecting resource markets that ebb and flow with the actions of all the players.\n\nThroughout the game, you will also be competing with your fellow supervisors to complete company goals, which will earn you progress cubes throughout the game. Progress cubes are also placed when you launch ships, and when a certain number of cubes are placed onto the company\u0026rsquo;s progress track, the game ends, and the player with the most Victory Points becomes the new CEO of Galactic Cruise.\n\nDo you still think you have what it takes to work for us? You do? Great. Let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

When the third winter card is drawn, the game ends immediately, then players tally their points based on the trees and dwellers in their forest. Whoever scores the most points wins.\n\nForest Shuffle is the first in a line of Lookout games sporting the Lookout Greenline label, produced on FSC certified paper and avoiding plastic completely.\n\n",

    "description": "ISS Vanguard is a 1-4 player co-operative campaign Board Game. It will bring players right into epic Sci-Fi adventure, as they will play as 4 sections (security, recon, science, engineering) onboard the first human ship with the potential to reach outer space.  The campaign will introduce the unique story written by Krzysztof Piskorski (Tainted Grail) full of hard player choices, twists and branching storylines. The game comes with over 100 different Crew members, each with unique characteristics.\n\nA game session takes you through a Ship Management phase (using a large binder with printed sleeves) in which you choose your destination for your ship then research technologies, produce equipment, recruit crewmembers and resolve situations, and then commence a Planetary Exploration phase. During said Planetary Exploration phase you will proceed with a daring landing procedure with your Lander, explore the planet for information or resources, fighting back a barrage of threats as well as a running timer of supplies depletion before you have to run back to the Lander to lift off back to ISS Vanguard. What follows is the remainder of the Ship Management phase, which takes you through unloading discoveries and resources from the Lander, healing or memorialising crewmembers and taking apart the game board and recording changes to the planet on which you\u0027ve just conducted your Planetary Exploration on, preserving its status for when you will want or need to return to it.\n\nThe Ship Management phase works allows players to make strategic decisions as to their resources and a way forward in the unknown galaxy chasing the mystery encoded in human\u0027s DNA. The Planetary Exploration draws the focus to the tactical, as players decide on cards, dice, crewmembers and equipment to bring to fulfill dice checks on the planet\u0027s Places of Interest. The players also decide which of the variety of specialised Landers they want to use and how to outfit their Lander for the perilous descent into the chosen planet\u0027s atmosphere (or lack thereof). Throughout the game, the narrative system relies on a web of structured and linked Mission Logs, often snippets of journal entries or dialogue, to provide gameplay choices and storyline information as well as keep track of progress throughout the universe.\n\n",

    "description": "The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.\n\nForbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same \u0026mdash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes \u0026mdash; or they will do the same to you.\n\nEach round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:\n\n\n     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources\n     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities\n     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units\n     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.\n\n\nThe last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.\n\nBecause of the game\u0027s three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game\u0027s set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game\u0027s four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force\u0027s strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.\n\n",

By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!\n\nPlacing workers allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to carve runes, build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle with the myriad enemies the town faces.\n\n",

The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player\u0027s deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents\u0027 troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your \u0022inner circle\u0022, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.\n\nWhen you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.\n\nA central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.\n\nPlayers gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.\n\n",

In a show of Roman might, he ordered a wall to be built that would separate the Pict tribes from the rest of England. Grand in its design, the wall stretched 80 Roman miles, from coast to coast. Hadrian\u0027s Wall stood in service to the Roman Empire for nearly 300 years before its eventual decline. Today, Hadrian\u0027s Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the remains of the forts, towers, and turrets can still be explored.\n\nIn Hadrian\u0027s Wall, players take on the role of a Roman General placed in charge of the construction of a milecastle and bordering wall. Over six years (rounds), players will construct their fort and wall, man the defenses, and attract civilians by building services and providing entertainment \u0026mdash; all while defending the honor of the Roman Empire from the warring Picts. The player who can accumulate the most renown, piety, valor and discipline, whilst avoiding disdain, will prove to the Emperor they are the model Roman citizen and be crowned Legatus Legionis!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\nFrom the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker\u0026mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.\n\nThis is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.\n\nPlayers build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent\u0027s deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent\u0027s life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent\u0027s life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.\n\nAn important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck!\n\nCards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.\n\nPlayers randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called \u0022the stack,\u0022 provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.\n\nThough traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.\n\n",

    "description": "In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nThe game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases\u0027 activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \u0022normal\u0022 spread of the infections.\n\nTaking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists\u0027 strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five\u0026mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!\n\nThe 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters\u0026mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist\u0026mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.\n\nPandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.\n\n",

While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike.\n\nEach trail represents one season of the year, and each season, the trails will change and grow steadily longer. The trails, represented by tiles, get shuffled in between each season and laid out anew for the next round. Resources can be tough to come by especially when someone is at the place you\u0026rsquo;re trying to reach! Campfires allow you to share a space and time with other hikers. Canteens and Gear can also be used to improve your access to resources through the game. It\u0026rsquo;ll be tough to manage building up your engine versus spending resources on parks, but we bet you\u0026rsquo;re up to the challenge. Welcome to PARKS!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the \u0026lsquo;Imascheren\u0026rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.\n\nThe board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent\u0027s meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.\n\nThe game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.\n\nThe display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).\n\nThe winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.\n\n",

Our rovers have confirmed 1-6 viable colonization options.\n\nPlanet Unknown is a competitive game for 1-6 players in which players attempt to develop the best planet. Each round, each player places one polyomino-shaped, dual-resource tile on their planet. Each resource represents the infrastructure needed to support life on the planet. Every tile placement is important to cover your planet efficiently and also to build up your planet\u0027s engine. After placing the tile, players do two actions associated with the two infrastructure types on the tile. Some tile placements trigger \u0022meteors\u0022 that make all planets harder to develop and prevent them from scoring points in the meteor\u0027s row and column.\n\nPlanet Unknown innovates on the popular polyomino trend by allowing simultaneous, yet strategic turn-based play via the Lazy S.U.S.A.N. space station in the center of the table.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer). It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the speed and interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. In Star Realms, players make use of Ships and Bases to generate Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases or to generate Combat to attack their opponent to reduce their Authority or destroy their Bases. When you reduce your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Authority to zero, you win!\n\nThe Ships and Bases in Star Realms come in four factions. You may acquire and use cards of any faction, but many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using cards of the same faction together. As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you play a Ship, you do what it says and then place it into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you play a Base, you place it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it\u0026rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Authority directly.\n\nStar Realms is easy to learn, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent\u0026rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you\u0026rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn\u0026rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.\n\nThe Star Realms set contains everything you need for two players. Including multiple copies (one copy for every two players) of the game and/or its standalone expansions, Star Realms: Colony Wars and Star Realms: Frontiers, allows up to six players to play a variety of multiplayer formats, including free-for-all and team play.\n\nThis is the first game of the Star Realms series.\n\n",

    "description": "In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories \u0026ndash; correct theories, that is \u0026mdash; and therein lies the problem.\n\nThe game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.\nPlayers declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there\u0027s academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don\u0027t want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.\n\nDuring play, players\u0027 reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nFlavor text:\nMandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad \u0026mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist\u0027s livelihood, science, and art.\n\nBut what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects \u0026mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist\u0027s cauldron.\n\n",

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you\u0027ll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.\n\nMore than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent\u0027s route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.\n\nThe overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nCopyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc.\n\nPart of the Ticket to Ride series.\n\n",

Reclaim the greatest share of the queen\u0026rsquo;s desired lands and you will be declared the greatest cartographer in the kingdom.\n\nIn Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale, players compete to earn the most reputation stars by the time four seasons have passed. Each season, players draw on their map sheets and earn reputation by carrying out the queen\u0027s edicts before the season is over. The player with the most reputation stars at the end of winter wins!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Now you must lead your troops forward as you push deeper into France and drive the German forces back.

    "description": "\u0022You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.\n\n\u0022But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn\u0027t be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother\u0027s side, would be delighted.\u0027\u0022\u0027\n\nIn Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \u0022buy\u0022 as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.\n\nDominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play\u0026mdash;leading to immense variety.\n\nDominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card. These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (\u0022you may\u0022 added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).\n\nDominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.\n\n",

    "year": 2011,
    "description": "The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with up to three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players\u0027 options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.\n\nThe core set contains three scenarios, twelve famous heroes from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor, and \u0026Eacute;owyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances of success and to explore new strategies. Additionally, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a Living Card Game with over ten years of content, and much of its content has been re-released in the form of Campaign and Hero Expansions. Campaign Expansions contain new scenarios for players to embark upon, and Hero Expansions contain new heroes and new cards for players to use in their decks. (Older products include Deluxe Expansions, each containing two heroes, three quests and a medium-sized number of new player cards, and Adventure Packs, each containing one hero, one quest that continues the story started in a Deluxe Expansion and a small number of new player cards.)\n\nAlthough this game is set in Tolkien\u0027s Middle-earth, most scenarios in the game do not represent scenes from The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings; rather, they are set in the seventeen years from Bilbo\u0027s 111th birthday until Frodo\u0027s departure from the Shire, allowing players to create their own stories and adventures in Middle-earth. Scenarios from the game\u0027s Saga Expansions do follow the events of the books, and can be played not only individually but also together in sequence as a campaign, with lasting consequences from game to game arising from the players\u0027 actions and decisions.\n\n",

In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.\n\nIn Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.\n\nPlayers use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players take turns placing their tribe members in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, each player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, in turn order. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.\n\n",

From his castle in Prague, he oversees construction of new fortifications: a bridge across the Vltava River, a university, and a cathedral rising within the walls of the castle itself. Prague is already among the largest cities in Europe. King Charles will make it the capital of an empire!\n\nIn Praga Caput Regni, players take the role of wealthy citizens who are organizing various building projects in medieval Prague. By expanding their wealth and joining in the construction, they gain favor with the king. Players choose from six actions on the game board \u0026mdash; the \u0022action crane\u0022 \u0026mdash; that are always available, but which are weighted with a constantly shifting array of costs and benefits. By using these actions, you can increase your resources, improve the strength of your chosen actions, and build \u0022New Prague City\u0022, the Charles Bridge, or city walls. You can possibly gain additional actions or even participate in the construction of St. Vitus Cathedral.\n\nClever players will discover synergies between carefully timed actions and the rewards from constructing civic projects as all of the mechanisms mesh together. At the end of the game, the player who most impressed King Charles wins.\n\n",

    "description": "Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition is an engine-building game in which players control interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable (and profitable). You will do this by investing mega credits (MC) into project cards that will directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process. In order to win, you will want to accumulate a high terraform rating (TR) and as many victory points (VP) as you can. Players raise their TR by increasing global parameters: oceans, oxygen, and temperature. TR also determines each corporation\u0027s basic income, and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP. Additional VP and production capabilities are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.\n\nThe game is played in rounds, and each round the players will choose one of five phases, which determines which activities will take place during that round. This means every round is different, but can consist of building new project cards, taking general and project-specific actions, producing income and resources (plants and heat), or researching to draw more project cards. Every player will take all the phases selected for the round, and will receive a special bonus during the phase that they selected. To speed up the game, within each phase, players can act simultaneously without waiting for each other!\n\nThe game board has tracks for oxygen, temperature, and terraform rating, as well as a place for all of the ocean tiles that will be flipped over the course of the game. The game ends when there is enough oxygen to breath (14%), oceans enough to allow Earth-like weather (9), and the temperature is well above freezing (\u002B8\u0026deg;C). It will then be possible, if not comfortable, to live on the surface of Mars!\n\nThe winner is the player with the most VP at the end of the game.\n\n",

    "description": "There\u0027s hustle and bustle at Istanbul\u0027s grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.\n\nIn Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...\n\nIn more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:\n\n\n    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.\n    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.\n    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.\n    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.\n    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.\n\n\nWhen a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who\u0027s reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.\n\n",

A game is typically played to 8 or 10 victory points, which may be accrued through winning attacks, controlling temples, controlling fully-developed pyramids, sacrificing to the gods, and wielding particular magical powers.\n\nThe conquest for the land of Kemet takes place over two phases: Day and Night. During the day, choose an action amongst the nine possible choices provided by your player mat and perform it immediately. Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.\n\nAs the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles. Some of these enroll magical creatures and have them join their troops. In addition to intimidating enemies, these creatures provide special powers!\n\nDetailed miniature components represent the combat units and the supernatural creatures that are summoned to enhance them. Combat is resolved through cards chosen from a diminishing six-card hand and enhanced by bonuses.\n\nPlay By Forum\n\n     Kemet PBF #1\n\n\n",

Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive. Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power.\n\nThe aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game\u0027s end. Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours. Each turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence among the various areas of society. The game ends once the Kingdom reaches poverty or prosperity - or potentially both!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Each player starts as a lowly but hopeful captain of a small starship.\n\nPlayers fly their ships about the system, completing a variety of missions, exploring new sectors and battling other ships. Navigating hazardous environments, players choose to mine, salvage, or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches and, most importantly, Fame.\n\nThe most adaptive, risk-taking and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!\n\nCustomize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid, yet fragile, explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship, ready for anything. In Xia, the choice is always yours.\n\nAdapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you\u0027ll do well in Xia!\n\nSandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play - players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play. Players might choose not to explore at all, creating a tiny arena for swift and deadly combat, or explore all 19 sectors and have a large play-scape to exploit. It\u0027s up to you!\n\nModding: Xia is very open to modding, and the community has already created loads of stuff. See BGG\u0027s Unofficial Xia:LoaDS mods and expansions wiki.\n\n",

    "name": "Glen More II: Chronicles",
    "year": 2019,
    "description": "Glen More II: Chronicles is a sequel to Glen More, expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game.\n\nIn Glen More II: Chronicles, each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.\n\nThe game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player\u0027s territory to the smallest one in play.\n\nThe core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.\n\nImprovements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.\n\nThe \u0022Chronicles\u0022 in the title \u0026mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game \u0026mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The \u0022Highland Boat Race\u0022 Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players\u0027 territories. The \u0022Hammer of the Scots\u0022 Chronicle adds a neutral \u0022Englishman\u0022 playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn \u0026mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a \u0022monster game\u0022.\n\nAnother major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new \u0022person\u0022 tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Have you ever had the desire to walk the streets of Victorian London with Sherlock Holmes in search of Professor Moriarty? To search the docks for the giant rat of Sumatra? To walk up Baker Street as the fog is rolling in and hear Holmes cry out, \u0022Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot!\u0022? Now you can! You can enter the opium den beneath the Bar of Gold, but beware, that may be Colonel Sebastian Moran lurking around the corner. You can capture the mystery and excitement of Holmes\u0027 London in this challenging and informative game. You, the player, will match your deductive abilities against your opponents and the master sleuth himself, Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, you are presented with a mystery to solve, and it is then up to you to trace the threads of evidence through the byways and mansions of nineteenth century London. You will interview suspects, search the newspapers for clues, and put together the facts to reach a solution.\n\nWhy were two lions murdered in Hyde Park? Who is responsible for the missing paintings from the National Gallery? Who murdered Oswald Mason and why? These are just a few of the cases that will challenge your ingenuity and deductive abilities.\n\nThis is not a board game: No dice, no luck, but a challenge to your mental ability. The game has been thoroughly researched for Holmesian and Victorian accuracy so as to capture a feeling of that bygone era.\n\n",

    "description": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!\n\nWhatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship\u0027s dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you\u0027ll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.\n\nStar Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What\u0027s more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you\u0027ll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...\n\nThe Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What\u0027s more, Star Wars: X-Wing\u0027s quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.\n\nReimplemented by Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)\n\n",

Littered with the modular debris of the precursor civilization, patrolled by malicious extragalactic raiders, and bordered by dense nebulae, The Edge is a last resort for the brave and foolhardy who seek a new life beyond the oppressive reach of the Lords of Unity.\n\nIn this game, you lead a desperate faction seeking to build a new civilization on Andromeda\u0026rsquo;s Edge. You begin with only a space station, a few ships, and a handful of resources. By carefully placing your ships, you will gather resources, claim moons, acquire modules to add to your station, populate planets, and build developments on them. You will battle opponents and compete with others to ascend the progress tracks: Science, Industry, Commerce, Civilization, and Supremacy.\n\nOn your turn, you either launch a starship or return your ships to your station. Launching sends one of your starships to a region of Andromeda, either collecting resources from planetary systems or taking actions at Alliance Bases. If the region is occupied by your opponents or fearsome raiders, face off in a dice battle, with Supremacy on the line but where strategic manipulation can turn a loss into a reward. Returning to your station allows you to activate your engine, using the modules you\u0026rsquo;ve acquired to generate energy, gain resources, and carry out actions.\n\nThroughout the game you will build up your unique faction, building developments (Observatories, Factories, Spaceports, Cities, and Obelisks) and gaining station modules which move you up the progress tracks. Advancement on the tracks is rewarded both during mid-game events and at the conclusion, and is the key to victory.\n\n",

    "description": "Take to the stars and become a living legend in Star Wars: Outer Rim, a game of bounty hunters, mercenaries, and smugglers for 1-4 players!\n\nIn Outer Rim, you take on the role of an underworld denizen, setting out to make your mark on the galaxy. You\u0027ll travel the outer rim in your personal ship, hire legendary Star Wars characters to join your crew, and try to become the most famous (or infamous) outlaw in the galaxy!\n\nBut it won\u0027t be easy since the warring factions of the galaxy roam the outer rim, hunting down the scum that have proven to be a thorn in their side, and other scoundrels looking to make their mark see you as the perfect target to bring down to bolster their own reputation. Do you have what it takes to survive in the outer rim and become a living legend?\n\nIn more detail, a game of Outer Rim takes place over a series of turns that sees players taking dangerous jobs, tracking down bounties, upgrading their ship, and more, all in service of gaining more and more fame. Regardless of the path you take to get there, your goal is to gain ten fame, which can come from a variety of sources, such as completing your character\u0027s personal goal, collecting on bounties and jobs, delivering illegal cargo, taking down patrols from the various factions struggling over the galaxy, and enjoying the finer things in life by purchasing luxury items with your hard-earned credits.\n\nWhile the path to victory may be different for scoundrels finding their way in the Outer Rim, everyone starts from the bottom with a simple starship. Your player board not only tracks your fame progress, but also contains slots for your ship, your character card, gear, reputation, modifications, jobs, and bounties.\n\n",

    "description": "You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, but that\u0027s not enough for you because only the merchant with two \u0022seals of excellence\u0022 will have the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja\u0027s court. You are therefore going to have to do better than your direct competitor by buying, exchanging, and selling at better prices, all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds.\n\nJaipur is a fast-paced card game, a blend of tactics, risk and luck. On your turn, you can either take or sell cards. If you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking one card from the market, or swapping 2-5 cards between the market and your cards.\n\nIf you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good, and you receive as many chips for that good as the number of cards you sold. The chips\u0027 values decrease as the game progresses, so you\u0027d better hurry! On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four, or five cards of the same good at a time, so you\u0027d better wait!\n\nYou can\u0027t sell camels, but they\u0027re paramount for trading and they\u0027re also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly.\n\n",

    "description": "In Great Western Trail: Argentina, you own a vast estancia in Argentina at the end of the 19th century, and you will need to travel the plains of the Pampas with your cattle to deliver them to the main train station in Buenos Aires.\n\nGreat Western Trail: Argentina features gameplay elements similar to Great Western Trail such as deck management, the rondel mechanism, and the ability to upgrade your player board, along with twists on these elements and new features.\n\nThe player board features a new type of worker \u0026mdash; farmers \u0026mdash; and different paths await on the game board to confront you with more choices. Will you take the road with buildings or a path past farmers? Maybe you\u0027ll have the chance to use your cows \u0026mdash; well, the strength on your cow cards \u0026mdash; to help farmers, getting them on your side and adding grain, a new type of resource, to your income, with grain being used for boat and city tiles.\n\nPerhaps you can unlock shortcuts that allow you to deliver your herd to Buenos Aires more quickly. Sure, you\u0027ll forfeit the use of action buildings, but maybe you can catch others unaware, with the ships leaving before they deliver. The timing of reaching the central train station to deliver your herd has never been so crucial, and valuable bonuses await on the city\u0027s port tiles.\n\nMoney is easier to get in Great Western Trail: Argentina, but you have more to manage in terms of action options, shortcuts, and cards (including the new exhaustion cards), so the challenges won\u0027t let up.\n\nGreat Western Trail: Argentina also includes a solitaire challenge in which Pedro is waiting for you to try to beat his score.\n\n",

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals. There\u0027s lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in Welcome To...!\n\nBecause of the communal actions, game play is simultaneous and thus supports large groups of players. With many varying strategies and completely randomized action sets, no two games will feel the same!\n\n",

Lauded by both the public and critics, 7 Wonders has claimed its place as an unmissable reference point in modern board gaming. 7 Wonders is based on a simple and elegant mechanic (drafting) which allows up to 7 players to play with no dead time. Players make their choice and apply all of them at the same time. These choices are varied and their impact is real. Finally, the game is divided into 3 Ages which little by little increase the importance of these choices and thus the tension in the game. The global mechanics and the care given to the artwork are used to immerse the player in Antiquity and have contributed to the game\u0026rsquo;s success.\nA game plays out over 3 rounds, called Ages, during which you simultaneously play cards, one at a time, to develop your City.\n\nThese cards represent the various Buildings you can construct: resource producers, civilian, commercial, military, scientific structures, and guilds.\n\nAt the end of each Age, you go to war with your nearest neighbours. At the end of all 3 Ages, you tally up all of the victory points earned by your City, your wonder, your military prowess, and your treasury. The player with the highest score wins the game.\n\nContent:\n7 Wonder boards\n148 Age cards: 49 Age I cards, 49 Age II cards, and 50 Age III cards\n78 Coins: 54 Coins of value 1, and 24 Coins of value 3\n48 Military Conflict tokens: 24 Defeats and 24 Victories (8 per Age)\n1 pad of score sheets\n3 quick reference sheets describing the effects of the cards\n1 List of cards and chaining leaflet\n1 rulebook\n\n",

    "description": "In John Company, players assume the roles of ambitious families attempting to use the British East India Company for personal gain. The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.\n\nJohn Company is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company\u0026rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.\n\nUltimately, this game isn\u0026rsquo;t about wealth; it\u0026rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity to establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.\n\nJohn Company engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players. Please make sure everyone in your group consents to this exploration before playing.\n\nThe second edition is extensively revised and is not a reprint.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from designer\n\n",

    "description": "This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city. You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity. During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices and have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later.\n\nTWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from video game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices. The boardgame significantly broadens the original game\u0026rsquo;s universe and emphasizes the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making.  TWOM: The Board Game is an instant play game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure.\n\nDuring day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements\u0026rsquo; shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep it warm.\n\nUpon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).\n\nYour goal is to survive until the cessation of war hostilities. However, survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.\n\n",

    "description": "The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game is a co-operative card game that plays out over eighteen chapters that lead players through the events of the novel The Fellowship of the Ring. The chapters can be played in any order, but ideally you play them in sequence.\n\nIn each chapter, each player takes a different character role \u0026mdash; Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Farmer Maggot, etc. \u0026mdash; and each character has a condition that must be met in order to pass the chapter and advance in the story. Frodo needs to capture ring cards, for example, while Pippin wants to take as few tricks as possible. As you advance through the chapters, new characters, items, and challenges are introduced to the game.\n\nThe deck consists of 37 cards, with one card being set aside as \u0022lost\u0022 each hand. Whoever is dealt the One Ring becomes Frodo, then other players choose from the available characters based on their hand. The One Ring is the game\u0027s only trump card, but initially rings can\u0027t be led until someone plays one off-suit.\n\nIn the two-player game, one hand of cards is dealt to a dummy player, with some cards being face up and others face down. This dummy is assigned a character, and one of the human players will play cards for it based on which cards are free to be played.\n\nIn the solitaire game, one player plays four hands of face-up cards, with each hand being assigned a character and only a few cards being available at a time. After you play a trick, deal each hand a new card.\n\nIf you own The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game, you can add the following characters to this version of the Road Goes Ever On...:\nBilbo (Peculiar), Gandalf (Grey Wizard), Gildor Inglorion, Fatty Bolger, Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, Barliman, Glorfindel, Bill the Pony, Gl\u0026oacute;in, Arwen, Boromir (Captain of Gondor), Gwaihir, Shadowfax (Lord of Horses), Radagast, Gandalf (Servant of the Secret Fire), Galadriel, and Celeborn.\n\n",

    "description": "In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA).\n\nInitially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.\n\nThe game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n    War of the Ring Collector\u0027s Edition\n    War of the Ring: Second Edition\n\n\nUpgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) \n\n    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit\n\n\n",

In the game, players take the role of explorers competing for the title of the most skilled nature observer. To win, they collect cards with the most valuable species, landscapes, and discoveries. Their journey is led by passion, a curiosity of the world, an inquiring mind, and a desire to discover the mysteries of nature. The competition continues at the bonfire where the players race to fulfill the goals of their adventures.\n\nIn this medium-weight board game for 1-4 players, you take turns placing path tokens on one of the two boards. Placing a token on the main board allows the player to get cards, but playing them requires meeting certain requirements. Playing a token on the bonfire board activates special actions (which helps to implement a chosen strategy) and gives the opportunity to achieve goals that provide additional points. Throughout the game, players collect cards in their meadow and surroundings area. At the end, the player with the most points on cards and on the bonfire board wins.\n\nMeadow also includes envelopes with additional cards to open at specific moments...\n\n",

Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.\n\n\u0022By design, the game is not overly complex\u0022, says Memoir \u002744 designer, Richard Borg. \u0022The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.\u0022 In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir \u002744 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.\n\nMemoir \u002744 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. With Memoir \u002744 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.\n\nThe Memoir \u002744 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.\n\nThis game is based upon Richard Borg\u0027s Command and Colors system.\n\n",

    "description": "Autumn is not the best time to climb up on a scaffold in Moscow, but it is still far better than doing so in the winter. Tsar Ivan wants to see results and our team will prove to him that we are the best builders in the city. We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the government\u0026rsquo;s trusted workers.\n\nSheila Santos and Israel Cendrero make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice. To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock \u0026 Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Rom\u0026aacute;n (El mundo de \u0026Aacute;guila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.\n\nThe Red Cathedral is a strategic, \u0026ldquo;Euro\u0026rdquo; board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil\u0027s cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.\n\nDuring the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources. Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.\n\nWhen the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section. The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.\n\nThe players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.\n\nThe game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.\n\nThe Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.\n\n",

The cosmic faculty of the Technical Academy of Creation is delighted to welcome you to your Civolution, the final exam in Civilization Design!\n\nFor this occasion, we prepared a humanoid scenario on an isolated continent. Here, each of you holds the rank of a local deity which is closely linked to its very own civilization and must lead it to success over the other civilizations. Your developmental possibilities are endless and reach from cultural and technical progress to evolutional adaptations. For example, what would you consider more beneficial to your tribes: inventing the wheel or growing wings? Demonstrate your ability to operate your civilization console and show us how well you can adjust to changeable environmental conditions and mild creational chaos.\n\nWhen the exam ceases after four eras, whoever managed to gather the most success points will not only pass the exam but will become a full member of the Technical Academy of Creation and garner the opportunity to be promoted to the next instance.\n\nCivolution is a medium heavy to heavy euro-style game that utilizes a dice selection mechanism to trigger actions on a tech tree-like structure. As you figure out how to best use your dice and put your unique cards into play, tons of strategies and paths to victory emerge, though each time you play, you will only explore a fraction of the possibilities that the game\u0026rsquo;s system and many cards provide.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\nA webapp implementation of the V.I.C.I solo automa is available (requires a physical copy of the game).\n\n",

Each board has some restrictions on which color or shade (value) of die can be placed there. Dice of the same shade or color may never be placed next to each other. Dice are drafted in player order, with the start player rotating each round, snaking back around after the last player drafts two dice. Scoring is variable per game based on achieving various patterns and varieties of placement...as well as bonus points for dark shades of a particular hidden goal color.\n\nSpecial tools can be used to help you break the rules by spending skill tokens; once a tool is used, it then requires more skill tokens for the other players to use them.\n\nThe highest scoring window artisan wins!\n\n",

    "description": "In Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition), one player takes on the role of the treacherous overlord, and up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes. During each game, the heroes embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot. Featuring double-sided modular board pieces, countless hero and skill combinations, and an immersive story-driven campaign, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) transports heroes to a vibrant fantasy realm where they must stand together against an ancient evil.\n\nWith danger lurking in every shadow, combat is a necessity. For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character\u0027s abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways. Surges, special symbols that appear on most dice, also let you trigger special effects to make the most of your attacks. And with the horrors awaiting you beneath the surface, you\u0027ll need every advantage you can take...\n\nCompared to the first edition of Descent: Journeys in the Dark, this game features:\n\n\n     Simpler rules for determining line of sight \n     Faster setup of each encounter\n     Defense dice to mitigate the tendency to \u0022math out\u0022 attacks\n     Shorter quests with plenty of natural stopping points\n     Cards that list necessary statistics, conditions, and effects\n     A new mechanism for controlling the overlord powers\n     Enhanced hero selection and creation process\n     Experience system to allow for hero growth and development\n     Out-of-the-box campaign system\n\n\n",

Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command. Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence. Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence. Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!\n\nSpace Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core \u0022I roll, everyone gets stuff\u0022 mechanism seen in other games. It\u0027s also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach. Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices.\n\n",

Still, the Empire\u0027s resources are vast, and the firepower of its Empire Navy is unmatched. With neither side willing to accept defeat, their war rages across the galaxy...\n\nIn Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game, a head-to-head game for two players, the galaxy-spanning war between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance comes alive on your tabletop. In this easy-to-learn game, you and your opponent each choose a side, playing as either the Empire or the Rebels, and as the game progresses you both strengthen the power of your starting decks and work to destroy each other\u0027s bases. The first player to destroy three of their opponent\u0027s bases wins.\n\nIn more detail, each player starts with a unique ten-card deck, with seven of those cards providing only resources to acquire new cards. Six cards from a galaxy deck are always on display, with Rebel cards facing the Rebel player, Empire cards the Empire player, and neutral cards turned sideways. You can spend resources to acquire cards in the galaxy row that don\u0027t belong to the opponent, and you can use attack power to take out cards that do belong to them, gaining a reward in the process.\n\nEach player starts with a base that lacks abilities (Dantooine for the Rebels and Lothal for the Empire), but when that base is destroyed, you get to choose a replacement from your base deck, with each base having a special ability. Choose wisely to counter your opponent\u0027s plans! In addition to having special abilities, capital ships absorb damage meant for your base.\n\nPlayers also fight for control of a Force track to gain additional resources or make use of \u0022If the Force is with you...\u0022 abilities on their cards.\n\n",

    "year": 2011,
    "description": "The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.\n\nSekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan\u0027s most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).\n\nThe campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.\n\nTo conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.\n\nSekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:\n\n        No dice are used\n        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.\n        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.\n        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.\n\n\nSekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan\u0027s two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.\n\nSekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.\n\nNo dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don\u0027t fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nLegitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo\u0027s control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.\n\nThe initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.\n\nBlocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.\n\nTrue to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.\n\nEach player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.\n\nTIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns\nMAP SCALE     Point to point\nUNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     2\n\nCOMPONENTS\n    Mounted Map\n    119 wooden pieces\n    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets\n    110 cards\n    Rulebook\n    Two player aid cards\n\nDESIGNER: Matthew Calkins\nMAP, CARD, \u0026 BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey\n\n(source: GMT website)\n\n",

On a player\u0027s turn, he or she becomes the offense. The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet. Both sides can invite allies and play cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.\n\nThe object of the game is for players to establish colonies in other players\u0027 planetary systems by landing their ships on the other players\u0027 planets. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on planets outside his or her home system. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory. And, because alliances are a key part of the game, multiple players can win together!\n\n",

It started with strange sightings: a flock of crows flying in circles until they dropped from the sky, the lake frozen solid in the height of summer. In time, they could not deny that which they most feared.\n\nThe evil had not been vanquished. The darkness would soon fall again. The tower will rise.\n\nA \u0022sequel\u0022 to the 1981 grail game, Return to Dark Tower is a game for 1-4 players who take the role of heroes. Together, they gather resources, cleanse buildings, defeat monsters, and undertake quests to build up their strength and discern what foe ultimately awaits them. When the heroes face the tower, the game shifts into its dramatic second act, where the players have one chance to defeat the enemy once and for all.\n\nThe game features both cooperative and competitive modes of play.\n\nThe game features traditional game mechanisms, such as engine building and resource management, paired with a technological interface unlike any seen before in games, including the titular tower, which holds more than a few secrets.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he\u0027s commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever \u0026mdash; subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he\u0027s building while also selling his services to other players.\n\nIn the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.\n\nAfter each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King\u0027s demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.\n\n",

Sometimes you need a fur, sometimes a tent, but these are all minor quests compared to your long-term goal: Painting a woolly mammoth on the wall so that humans thousands of years later will know that you once existed. (Okay, you just think the mammoth painting looks cool. Preserving a record of your past existence is gravy.)\n\nWhat might keep you from painting that mammoth? Death, in all its many forms.\n\nEach player starts the game with a couple of humans, who each have a skill and a number of life points. On a turn, each player chooses to go to one location \u0026mdash; possibly of the same type as other players, although not the same location \u0026mdash; and while you have some idea of what you might find there, you won\u0027t know for sure until you arrive, at which point you might acquire food or resources, or find what you need to craft a useful object, or discover that you can help someone else in their project, or suffer a snakebite that brings you close to death. Life is full of both wonders and terrors...\n\nAt the day\u0027s end, you need food for all the people in your party as well as various crafts or skills that allow you to complete quests. Failure to do so adds another skull on the tote board, and once you collect enough of those, you decide that living is for fools and give up the ghost, declaring that future humans can just admire someone else, for all you care.\n\nPaleo includes multiple modules that allow for a variety of people, locations, quests, and much more during your time in 10,000 BCE.\n\n",

The goal is to enclose territory behind stone perimeters and, secondarily, to tightly surround and capture enemy stones. The game ends when both players pass. The players then add up their territory and deduct the number of captives lost. High score wins.\n\nThe concept of Go is simple, yet the tactics and strategies are deep enough to enrich a lifetime. Actually many lifetimes, for the game has been played for thousands of years. With so long a lineage and a worldwide following, Go has come to be known by different names (Weiqi, Igo, Baduk) and to be played by differing rules. The rule differences are small, though, and seldom affect play.\n\nSo welcome to this masterpiece that is the game of Go, the race for geographical control of an unclaimed land. Experience running battles and swift reversals, bold invasions and painful sacrifices, each sally, each setback playing out to the tap of stone on wood.\n\n",

    "year": 2011,
    "description": "Game description from the publisher:\n\nKing Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.\n\nIn the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!\n\nTo begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.\n\nEach round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.\n\nThe Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!\n\nDuring the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.\n\nIn addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.\n\nTides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What\u0027s more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Dance with Dragons (2012)\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Feast for Crows (2013)\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 Mother of Dragons (2018)\n\n\nReimplements:\n\n     A Game of Thrones (2003)\n     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)\n     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)\n\n\n",

This version was initially available only in the Nordic Countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland; a worldwide limited-edition release occurred in August 2008 and it has since been kept in print again by Days of Wonder.\n\nThe goal in \u0022Nordic\u0022 remains the same as base Ticket to Ride: collect and play cards to place your trains on the board, attempting to connect the different cities on your ticket cards. The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries. Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played, as well as other cards, in order to be claimed. Locomotives are handled a bit differently as well. On your turn you may take 2 Locomotives if you want, but you can only use them on ferries, tunnels, or the special 9 length route.\n\nUnlike the USA or Europe maps, Nordic is designed for 2-3 players only and has a heavier focus on blocking your opponent and more aggressive play.\n\nAlthough not an official expansion for this set, Ticket to Ride Map Collection 5: United Kingdom \u0026 Pennsylvania can be used as an expansion for Nordic Countries, although limited to the three players included in this set.  Nordic Countries includes three sets of 40 trains, with 5 spare for each colour; the UK map in Ticket to Ride Map Collection 5: United Kingdom \u0026 Pennsylvania requires 35 trains and the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains.\n\nPart of the Ticket to Ride series.\n\n",

    "year": 2019,
    "description": "At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal\u0027s greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans \u0026mdash; whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.\n\nIn Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.\n\nAzul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.\n\nAt the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.\n\nAfter all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.\n\nIf you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.\n\nAfter six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you\u0027ve filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Railways of the World (2009) is the new edition of the base game for Eagle Games\u0027 popular Railways of the World series, first published as Railroad Tycoon in 2005.  It reimplements the original game with several improvements.\n\nRevisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon \u0022mission\u0022 card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!\n\nMultiple expansions featuring different maps are available.  Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.\n\nThis game is preceded by the designer\u0027s other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas.  Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace\u0027s Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nA revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.\n\nComplete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game\n\nNote: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n     Steam\n\n\n",

In this game, you\u0027ll come face to face with them all as you work together to rid the town of the maniacal or misunderstood creatures - before it\u0027s too late.\n\nHorrified is a co-operative game where players battle the classic Universal movie monsters. Players win or lose together. Players win when all Monsters are defeated but will lose if the Terror track reaches the skull space OR the Monster deck is empty when a card is needing to be drawn.\n\nOn a player\u0026rsquo;s turn, they will do their Hero phase actions. Then the Monsters act in the Monster phase. Event cards determine which monster is in play.\n\nHorrified includes high-quality sculpted miniatures (Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, Creature from the Black Lagoon). Its innovative, easy-to-learn, cooperative gameplay has players working together against the monsters with varying levels of difficulty. Just as each monster is unique, they require different strategies and tactics to be defeated.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Carcassonne is a tile placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape represented on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.\n\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \u0022Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\u0022 or \u0022Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, thus making it a harder for them to complete it and score points?\u0022 Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.\n\nFirst game in the Carcassonne series.\n\n",

    "description": "In Ora et Labora (Latin for \u0027Pray and work\u0027), each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings \u0026ndash; little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items \u0026ndash; such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics \u0026ndash; to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.\n\nOra et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg\u0027s fifth \u0022big\u0022 game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.\n\nEach player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.\n\nPlayers also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you\u0027ve placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player\u0027s buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he\u0027ll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.\n\nOra et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.\n\n",

If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card\u0026mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don\u0027t get it\u0026mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.\n\nAll of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points.

Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.\n\nAll the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game. Roles include: the Captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; the Radio Operator listening to the opposing captain\u0027s orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; the Engineer working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.\n\nCaptain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded \u0026mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.\n\nMultiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.\n\n",

    "description": "Life in the village is hard \u0026ndash; but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.\n\nEach player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.\n\nVillage is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.\n\nParaphrased from Opinionated Gamer\u0027s review:\n\nEach player\u0026rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.\n\n",

Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents.\n\nSuburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you\u0027ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you\u0027ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high-rise office building. As your reputation increases, you\u0027ll gain more and more population \u0026mdash; and the player with the largest population at the end of the game wins.\n\nDuring each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost \u0026mdash; and the buildings available in each game vary, so you\u0027ll never play the same game twice!\n\nThe second edition of Suburbia features updated artwork, larger tiles than in the original game, a dual-sided scoreboard, GameTrayz storage organizers, and more!\n\n",

After crashing far from your companions, you have complete freedom as to how you explore, discover, and interact with the planet. You view your location from a first-person perspective, and you can communicate with and support other players, but you are separated by vast distances, so only you can see your current location.\n\nIn addition to a mission victory, a destiny victory, or an epic victory (completing both the mission and a destiny), you may define success in Vantage through anything you pursue and achieve.\n\nVantage is not a campaign game. Each game is a standalone experience; you bring to future sessions only what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned about the world.

    "description": "From the designer (about his Commands and Colors system, C\u0026C: Ancients, and Memoir\u0027 44):\n\n\u0022Commands \u0026 Colors: Ancients depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Dark Ages (400 AD). Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands \u0026 Colors, by design, is a unique historical wargame system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.\n\n\u0022The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.\n\n\u0022Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill, Commands \u0026 Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.\n\n\u0022The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.\n\n\u0022The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.\n\n\u0022The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.\u0022\n\n",

    "description": "Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.\n\nThe game uses either one or two standard 52-card decks with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it\u0027s your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination \u0026mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. \u0026mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.\n\nThe last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player\u0027s unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses \u0026mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call \u0022Tichu\u0022 prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call \u0022Grand Tichu\u0022 after looking at only their first eight cards for a \u0026plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).\n\nThe first team to 1,000 points wins.\n\n",

    "year": 2014,
    "description": "\u0022Crossroads\u0022 is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors\u0027 ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.\n\nDead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that\u0027s fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group\u0027s goal, but don\u0027t get walked all over by a loudmouth who\u0027s looking out only for their own interests!\n\nDead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony\u0027s morale up.\n\nDead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what\u0027s best for the colony and what\u0027s best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.\n\n",

When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of five markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with. Very tricky!\n\n",

Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets \u0026ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.\n\n\u0022The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket \u0026ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,\u0022 says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. \u0022The tension comes from being forced to balance greed \u0026ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear \u0026ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.\u0022\n\nTicket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder\u0027s big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.\n\nSince its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a \u0022gateway game\u0022 -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.\n\nPart of the Ticket to Ride series.\n\n",

    "description": "The KLASK game board is shaped like a ball field with two deep holes functioning as goals in each end of the field. In the middle of the field, three white magnetic pieces serve as \u0022obstacles\u0022 \u0026ndash; do NOT attract them to your own gaming piece! Your gaming piece is a black magnet. You control it by holding a large magnet under the board. This magnet is connected to a small magnet placed on the field. The purpose of the game is to push the small, red ball around on the field with your magnet/gaming piece, shoot the ball past the obstacles and your opponent and into the goal hole (Klask). It\u0026rsquo;s so much fun when your opponent suddenly is covered in white obstacles or you drop your gaming piece into the goal \u0026ndash; something which might happen if you get a little too eager!\n\nPlace the game board on a table between the two players. Place the three white magnetic pieces on the white fields on the board. Put two coins in each point slot next to the \u00220\u0022. Each player has a black magnetic gaming piece in two parts. Place the short (thin) part on top of the board and the long (thick) part under the board in such a way, so the two parts \u0026ldquo;catch\u0026rdquo; each other. Place the ball in the corner start field. Steer it with the black gaming pieces.\n\nThe youngest player starts the game. You score a point if:\n\n\n    The ball ends in your opponent\u0027s hole and stays in the hole.\n    Two or all of the three white magnetic pieces stick to your opponent\u0027s gaming piece.\n    The opponent accidentally pulls their gaming piece into their own goal hole.\n    If the opponent loses their gaming piece.\n\n\nEach time you get a point, you must move your coin one point forward in the point slot. The player who first reaches the KLASK field wins.\n\nDuring the game:\n\n\n    If one of the white magnetic pieces sticks to a gaming piece, the game continues; if two of the white magnetic pieces stick to one gaming piece, the opponent gets one point.\n    If the ball falls over the edges of the board, you must place the ball in the corner start field in the half from which the ball fell.\n    If one or more white magnetic pieces fall over the edges of the board, the game continues.\n    Each time a player scores a point, you must put the white magnetic pieces back on the white fields on the board, and the player who did not score a point places the ball in their corner start field.\n\n\n",

You\u0027ll need to carefully manage your Keys to influence the Messenger pawn at critical moments, as it controls which characters are available for recruitment from two different areas \u0026ndash; peasants and nobles.\n\nBalancing your Gold reserves is equally important, ensuring you can afford the characters that best suit your strategy throughout the game. Selecting the right characters is crucial to maximising their immediate effects and the points they will contribute at the game\u0027s end. Finally, carefully arranging these characters on your 3x3 board is key to unlocking their full potential.\n\nAfter everyone has played 9 turns (i.e., everyone has 9 characters in front of them), the player with the most points in their tableau wins the game.\n\n",

While there are many paths to victory,\u0026nbsp;players should always seek to optimize their\u0026nbsp;opportunities with every roll of the dice.\u0026nbsp;Combined with ever-changing synergies of the citizens, expeditions, and monasteries, no two games of Coimbra will ever be the same!\n\n",

Roam across the land in search of its secrets, meet its inhabitants, and list its wonders in order to gain more fame than your opponents.\n\nThroughout a game of Faraway, you will play a row of 8 cards in front of you, from left to right. These cards represent the regions you will come across while exploring the lands. Characters on these cards will grant you victory points if you later fulfill the conditions they demand. At the end of the game, you walk back the same way, scoring cards in the opposite order you played them. There lies the heart of the gameplay. Throughout the game, the cards you play will serve both to set new objectives, and to meet the ones you played previously.\n\nEach turn, you play a card from a hand of 3. Then you pick a new card from a face-up river. As play is simultaneous in Faraway, you must take into account a clever priority system in all of your choices \u0026ndash; being last to pick a card leaves you with fewer options and often less profitable choices for the next turns.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\nRelated Microbadges\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We are all orphans of the Great War.\n\nPaths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S.

As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful \u0027place in the sun.\u0027 As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war \u0027to end all wars.\u0027 Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory\u0027s innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.\n\nComponents:\n\n     316 full-color die-cut counters:\n         176 5/8\u0026rdquo; die cut counters\n         140 1/2\u0026rdquo; die cut counters\n    \n     One 22x34\u0022 full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East\n     110 Strategy Cards\n     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)\n     Two Player Reference Cards \n\n\nDESIGNER: Ted Raicer\nDEVELOPER: Andy Lewis\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B. MacGowan\nMAP ART: Mark Simonitch\nCARDS \u0026 COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch\n\n\n(BGG description:)\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of We the People, Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Successors: The Battles for Alexander\u0027s Empire (First/Second Edition), and For the People, Paths of Glory utilizes a similar card-driven system.  The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.\n\nWhile the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.\n\n",

Fight the invaders city by city. Build a team from around the globe to save your planet and defeat the aliens!\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nUnder Falling Skies is a solo game with a multi-mission campaign. In each mission, you take charge of defending a besieged city.\n\nYour actions are powered by an innovative dice placement mechanic. When you choose an action, you are also choosing which enemy ships will descend. Bigger numbers give better effects, but they also cause ships to descend faster.\n\nExpand your underground base to gain access to more powerful actions,  allowing you to shoot down enemy ships or deploy robots to increase your workforce, but don\u0027t forget to work on your research and watch your energy supply.\n\nThe mothership draws closer every round, ratcheting up the tension.\n\nCan you complete your mission before your base is destroyed?\n\nOfficial rules: https://czechgames.com/files/rules/under-falling-skies-rules-en.pdf\n\n\nUnder Falling Skies is based on the print \u0026 play game that won the 2019 9-card Nanogame P\u0026P Design Contest. Built on the same intriguing mechanics, it now comes with a full-scale campaign providing even more content for hours of intense fun. \n\n",

    "description": "Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930s Germany. Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u0027s too late. The liberal team always has a majority.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn\u0027t know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don\u0027t know who anyone is.\n\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\n\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.\n\n",

Select a single patch tile from your hand and sew it into your quilt, then draw another patch into your hand from the three available. If you are able to create a color group, you may sew a button onto your quilt. If you are able to create a pattern combination that is attractive to any of the cats, it will come over and curl up on your quilt!

The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win \u0026mdash; should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don\u0027t run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who\u0027s going to run when?

    "description": "From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!\n\nNations is an intense historical board game for 1\u0026ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.\n\nGameplay introduction\n\nPlayers choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:\n\n\n     Buy a card\n     Deploy a worker\n     Hire an architect for a wonder\n     Special action provided by a card\n\n\nPlayers each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.\n\nWhen all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.\n\nVictory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points is the winner.\n\nSee \u0027More information\u0027 below for link to rules, etc.\n\n",

Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the gods, as only one player can have the favor of each god per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single god per turn.\n\n     Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of Fortresses.\n     Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build Ports.\n     Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples.\n     Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities.\n     Apollo increases the income of his worshipers.\n\n\n",

(Why you don\u0027t already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)\n\nTo set up play, lay out 25 word cards in a 5\u0026times;5 grid. Place a key card in the holder so that each player sees one side of the card. Each player sees a 5\u0026times;5 grid on the card, with nine of the squares colored green (representing your agents) and three squares colored black (representing assassins). Three of the nine squares on each side are also green on the other side, one assassin is black on both sides, one is green on the other side and the other is an innocent bystander on the other side.\n\nCollectively, you need to reveal all fifteen agents \u0026mdash; without revealing an assassin \u0026mdash; before time runs out in order to win the game. Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct, they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin, you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier. After the first clue is given, players alternate giving clues.\n\n",

    "description": "Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more \u0026ldquo;Fate\u0026rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate their units on the mapboard for various military functions.\n\nPlayers attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent\u0026rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario\u0026rsquo;s specific \u0026ldquo;Objective\u0026rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent\u0026rsquo;s board edge.\n\nA game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card \u0022Orders\u0022 conducted by the active player. Fate Card \u0022Actions\u0022 may generally be conducted by either player at any time. \u0022Events\u0022 \u0026mdash; both good and bad \u0026mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player\u0026rsquo;s perfect plan.\n\nSCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.\n\nEach unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad. Radios \u0026mdash; and individual weapons larger than a pistol, rifle or BAR \u0026mdash; are represented by their own counters.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n",

Over time, the players develop their farms and deliver goods to the village. Players are vying to earn the title of \u0022La Granja\u0022 for their country estate!\n\nOver the course of 6 game rounds, players will expand their farm by adding fields, farm extensions, market barrows, and helpers.  They will earn VPs by delivering goods to the village of Esporles.  It is important to observe the actions of other players, manipulate turn order, and adjust your strategy based on the dice and cards.\n\nLa Granja is a fascinating game that requires careful planning. Timing and speed is crucial. However, successful players must cope with the uncertainty of events during the game. The player who has earned the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner and new owner of the La Granja estate!\n\n",

    "description": "The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era is a cooperative tabletop adventure set during Tamriel\u0027s Second Era \u0026ndash; specifically during the events of the Planemeld, as the Order of the Black Worm plots to secure the Amulet of Kings. As the dark cult schemes, however, one of its members is planning an even darker betrayal, one that will tie Tamriel in with Oblivion forever. Adventurers work to uncover her machinations and stop her plot amid a bevy of endlessly replayable content. As in The Elder Scrolls video games, players will travel on an epic journey, balancing exploration, character building, dungeon diving and close quarters combat.\n\nEach adventure in the game takes place over the course of three gameplay sessions, with sessions being roughly two hours plus an additional half hour per player in length. Players customize and control a single hero throughout all three sessions of an adventure as they manage multiple skill lines, classes and experience the many regions of Tamriel, each with their own unique flavor and mechanics. Experience points are handed out generously, allowing players to build interesting and unique characters in the consolidated timespan required in a tabletop experience. Session to session progression is meaningful, but players are not required to remember complex narrative points or play with the same group forever.\n\n",

    "description": "Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain\u0027s attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain\u0027s particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks \u0026ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. \u0026ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what\u0027s available.\n\nOver the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player\u0027s turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains \u0022master strike\u0022 cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.\n\nAs players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game\u0027s end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however \u0026ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes \u0026ndash; then the players all lose.\n\nHero decks in the base game: Gambit, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Emma Frost, Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Storm, Captain America, Nick Fury, Rogue, Cyclops, Hulk, Wolverine, Deadpool\n\n",

    "description": "Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions \u0026mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.\n\nGameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.\n\nAt the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, \u0022non-majority\u0022 symbols each player has collected.\n\nThe game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.\n\n",

Gather your gun, your mount, and your grit as you forge your path into the history books.\n\nWestern Legends is an open-world sandbox tabletop adventure for 2-6 players set in the American Wild West. Players assume the roles of historical figures of the era, earning their legendary status in a variety of ways: gamble, drive cattle, prospect for gold, rob the bank, fight bandits, pursue stories, become an outlaw, keep the peace. The possibilities are darn near endless.\n\nEach player\u0027s turn starts with drawing poker cards and/or gaining cash. Then they choose three actions. Possible actions include: move on the map (how far depends on whether they have a mount), doing a location-specific action (such as mine for gold if they are at a gold mine, gamble if they\u0027re in a saloon, etc.), fight other players at the same location (either duel them, rob them, or arrest them if they\u0027re wanted), play poker cards that have action abilities, etc. Legendary Points (LPs) are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions, and the winner is whoever has the most LPs at the end of the game.\n\nKey Points\n- Award-winning gaming experience set in the American West!\n- Beautiful artwork, and presentation brings this highly thematic game to life.\n- Intuitive gameplay and choices lets you write your own legend every game!\n\nNote: The Russian edition of Western Legends contains two expansions packaged inside the box and thus has its own entry here: \u041B\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043D\u0434\u044B \u0414\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0417\u0430\u043F\u0430\u0434\u0430 (Western Legends)\n\n",

Each case includes a number of cards that ask you to find something on the map or uncover where someone has gone or otherwise reveal information relevant to a case. The city map serves as a map in time as well as space, so you\u0027ll typically find people in multiple locations throughout the streets and buildings, and you need to piece together what happened, whether by going through the case card by card or by reading only the starting card in the case and trying to figure out everything that happened for yourself. Will you be able to answer all questions about the case without fail?\n\nThe second edition of MicroMacro: Crime City now marks each case with symbols so that parents can decide which cases the youngest investigators are cleared to research.\n\n",

    "description": "Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.\n\nIn the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case \u0026ndash; but there\u0027s a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player\u0027s role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer\u0027s team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!\n\nThe Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!\n\nFind out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!\n\nRoles\n\nForensic Scientist x1\nAs the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the \u0026ldquo;Key Evidence\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Means of Murder.\u0026rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.\n\nDuring the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.\n\nMurderer x1\nWhen the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the \u0026ldquo;Key Evidence\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Means of Murder\u0026rdquo; respectively.\n\nThe Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the \u0026ldquo;Key Evidence\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Means of Murder\u0026rdquo;.\n\nInvestigators x8\nTo solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the \u0026ldquo;Key Evidence\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Means of Murder,\u0026rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).\n\nBear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.\n\nAccomplice x1\nThe Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.\n\nWitness x1\nThe Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.\n\nIf the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.\n\n",

The arcane powers of the Necromancers have unleashed a zombie invasion in the age of swords and sorcery, and it\u0027s up to your group of straggling survivors to not only stay alive during these dark times, but to take back the realm and punish those responsible for the apocalypse!\n\nZombicide: Black Plague allows you take control of paladins, dwarves, knights, and magicians, wielding powerful swords, crossbows, and even magic spells to defeat the zombie hordes and its Necromancer overlords. The classic Zombicide rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game, while still retaining the nonstop action, tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made Zombicide a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!\n\nTake on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts). Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre).\n\n",

Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you\u0027ve mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.\n\nBattle of Legends, Volume One features four heroes. King Arthur sacrifices cards to power up his attacks and gets some timely assistance from Merlin\u0027s magic. Alice is back from Wonderland with a giant vorpal blade and the Jabberwock by her side as she grows and shrinks to gain advantages on attack and defense. Medusa is happy to attack from range and let her harpies hound you, but just one devastating glance could end the battle quickly. Sinbad grows in power as he gains experience on each of his voyages.\n\nCombat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card\u0027s unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh\u0026auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.\n\nThe game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that\u0027s brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.\n\n",

The landscape of Isle of Skye is breathtaking and fascinates everyone.\n\nIn the tile-laying game Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King, 2\u0026ndash;5 players are chieftains of famous clans and want to build their kingdoms to score as many points as possible\u0026mdash;but in each game only four of the sixteen scoring tiles will be scored.\n\nThanks to the scoring tiles, each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies, but having enough money is useful no matter what else is going on. Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.\n\nIn the end, the player with the best kingdom\u0026mdash;and not the richest player\u0026mdash;becomes the sovereign of the island.\n\n",

    "description": "In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.\n\nGlory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don\u0027t follow may \u0027think\u0027 to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.\n\nThe lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the \u0027black box\u0027 edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.  Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork.\n\n",

You must collect the required resources to fulfill contracts, invest in the construction of monumental cathedrals, gain the favor of noble families, and participate in important fairs where your main business occurs. You will also use the services of notable people who will be welcomed into your houses. You will thus gain prestige that will make you the most famous merchant of the Renaissance.\n\nTiletum is a dice management game in which dice have a dual function: gaining resources and performing actions. A certain number of dice will be rolled each round. On your turn, choose a die to gain the number of corresponding resources equal to the value of the die, then perform the associated action. The power of the action is inversely proportional to the value of the die, so the fewer resources you gain, the more powerful the actions you take and vice versa.\n\n",

    "description": "Vindication (formerly Epoch: The Awakening) is a highly strategic, fantasy-based tabletop journey for 2-5 players. Play time is 15-30 minutes per player.\n\nThrown overboard for a life of wretchedness, you wash ashore a hostile island ruins \u0026mdash; completely alone with nothing except the breath in your lungs and an undaunted spirit.\n\nThrough your advanced resource management, area control tactics, and freeform action selection, you\u0026rsquo;ll add companions to your party, acquire bizarre relics, attain potent character traits, and defeat a host of unusual monsters in the ultimate goal of mastering heroic attributes \u0026mdash; and regaining honor.\n\nYou may perform 3 actions on each turn in the order you feel is most advantageous that turn:  activate a companion, travel to a new location, and interact with a map tile. Many actions require the the use of your influence to gain attributes in a one-of-a-kind heroic attribute alchemy system, which is leveraged to gain the game\u0027s most powerful rewards. For example, you can meditate at a spire to gain inspiration. You can train at a fort to gain strength. But then you can combine your inspiration and strength to gain the courage (inspired strength) which allows you to perform a bounty hunt.\n\nThere are distinctive end-game triggers that can be affected through game play, over 72 unique card abilities that can be merged in unusual ways for potent combinations, and fresh tile placement each game for high replayability.\n\n",

    "description": "Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard, Euchre and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they\u0027ll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.\n\nSkull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, two Mermaids, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they\u0027ll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).\n\nStandard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards \u0026mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything \u0026mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.\n\nIf a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number \u0026mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.\n\n",

The game includes basic rules for two-player games, along with rules for multiplayer formats such as Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra.\n\nEach player starts the game with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent\u0027s score (called health) to zero, you win!\n\nMultiple expansions are available for Hero Realms that allow players to start as a particular character (Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Thief, or Wizard) and fight cooperatively against a Boss, fight Boss decks against one another, or compete in a campaign mode that has you gain experience to work through different levels of missions.\n\n",

To do so, they will have the help of the y\u014Dkai, the kodamas and the different pilgrims that accompany them on their path. This is a hand-management, engine-building game with multiple paths to victory.\n\nPlayers will have y\u014Dkai represented by the cards that make up their hand, which must be placed in the right places at the right times in order to obtain the maximum benefit from the abilities they offer. Furthermore, during the game players can earn more y\u014Dkai cards for their deck, thereby increasing their playing options and achieving a higher score. Each player also has three y\u014Dkai guardians (in the form of dice) that they can send to the large regions of the forest on the main board in order to obtain all kinds of new options that they can play during the game. These options can be structures they build in certain areas of the forest, soul crystals that generate resources when certain actions are carried out, and many others as well. The players also have the chance to help the mitamas, lost souls in search of redemption by using the chinkon fireflies.\n\nThere is truly a wide range of actions to carry out, and this is without taking into account the personal domain where the players can lay out another layer of additional strategy while managing the pilgrims. Pilgrims are followers of the player who embark upon journeys of contemplation and reflection who then share the experiences and learning they can along the spirit path with the Bitoku.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Without Spice, space travel is impossible, and humans become little clusters on isolated planets. The noble House that controls Arrakis and the production of Spice wields great power. The Emperor gave Arrakis to House Atreides, but then he conspired to replace them with their old rivals, House Harkonnen. Baron Harkonnen crushed the Atreides in a treasonous attack, and now rules the planet with an iron fist. But Paul and Jessica, heirs to House Atreides, are alive, and are mounting a rebellion with the aid of the formidable Fremen, the mysterious inhabitants of the barren expanses of Arrakis.\n\nOnly one House will emerge victorious from the coming struggle, while the other will be lost in the desert sands. It\u0027s into this grim reality that players will be thrust in Dune: War for Arrakis.\n\nIn this asymmetrical strategy game, players fight for control of the planet, maneuvering troops like the Fremen, the Fedaykin, and the fearsome Sardaukar, while sending Spice harvesters into the deep desert, daring to challenge the great Sandworms. The game features an action dice system with numerous event cards that will enable players to retell the Dune saga differently with each playthrough.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.\n\nEach turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.\n\nAfter the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it\u0027s not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.\n\nThe game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.\n\nThe 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.\n\n",

Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played.\n\nThe rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps:\n\n1. Move - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.\n\n2. Build - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved.  When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.\n\nIf either of your builders moves up to the third level, you win.\n\n",

    "description": "\u0022Kanban\u0022 \u0026mdash; or \u770B\u677F, the Japanese word for billboard \u0026mdash; is a term for the visual cues that might be used in a lean, efficient assembly line in order to expedite and smooth workflow. These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.\n\nThe setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate \u0026mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable \u0026mdash; failure \u0026mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.\n\nOver the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn\u0027t wait for you or for mistakes.\n\nLike the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:\n\n\n    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (\u0022nice\u0022 or \u0022mean\u0022) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.\n    Two independent player-influenced game timers \u0026mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock \u0026mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.\n    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.\n    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.\n    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.\n\n\nIf you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver\u0027s seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.\n\n",

    "description": "1830 is one of the most famous 18xx games. One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no \u0027chance\u0027 element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.\n\nThis game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham\u0027s 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, \u0027robber baron\u0027 oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.\n\nThe 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham\u0027s original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world\u0027s best railroad game developers.\n\n",

Each round, the players decide which of their actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces.  If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cube Tower plays the leading role: cubes (representing troops) from both sides are thrown in together, and those that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points at the end of the game becomes \u0026ndash; SHOGUN!\n\nShogun is based on the Wallenstein game system. The game is an international edition with language-independent components and five language-dependent rule booklets.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Wallenstein\n\n\n",

    "description": "In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.\n Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?\n\nOf course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It\u0027s loads of fun.\n\nGalaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.\n\nBuilding happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won\u0027t know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don\u0027t want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.\n\nOnce building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, combat zones, and other various things.\n\nMost of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!\n\n3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!\n\n",

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n\nThe players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There\u0027s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n\nFortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.\n\nUsing those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.\n\n",

They grew in size and intelligence to become a highly advanced society. They call themselves Mellifera, and they have made substantial technological advances in addition to the technology they adapted from human ruins, up to and including space travel.\n\nIn Apiary, each player controls one of twenty unique factions. Your faction starts the game with a hive, a few resources, and worker bees. A worker-placement, hive-building challenge awaits you: explore planets, gather resources, develop technologies, and create carvings to demonstrate your faction\u0027s strengths (measured in victory points) over one year\u0027s Flow.

However, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Mind MGMT is now rotting from the inside. To tighten its iron grip on the world stage, Mind MGMT deploys covert operatives around the world to recruit other psychically-attuned individuals to their side. How can this enigmatic organization, hell bent on global domination, be defeated?\n\nThankfully, a few renegade agents have figured out that Mind MGMT has been compromised and have defected, turning their backs on the syndicate. They now use their own psychic abilities to prevent Mind MGMT from achieving its nefarious goals.\n\nIn Mind MGMT: The Psychic Espionage \u0022Game\u0022 one player controls Mind MGMT and must scour the city for new recruits. They move around on a secret map, trying to visit locations that match one of their three randomly drawn feature cards. They can also use their four Immortals to protect locations from being exposed.\n\nAll other players control the rogue agents who must try to stop Mind MGMT before it\u0027s too late! They ask questions to the Recruiter and deduce their whereabouts from the answers they receive. Rogue agents can use dry-erase \u0022mental notes\u0022 to track all the information they\u0027re given.\n\nMind MGMT wins by either collecting twelve recruits or surviving sixteen turns. The rogue agents can win only by capturing Mind MGMT, which they do when they believe they\u0027re on the same block as Mind MGMT.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "year": 2007,
    "description": "From the author:\n\n\u0022Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.\n\n\u0022In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters\u0027 pocket books in mind.\n\n\u0022The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960\u0026mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon\u0026rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower\u0026rsquo;s late endorsement, and the \u0027Catholic question\u0027 are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state\u0026rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.\n\n\u0022As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.\u0022\n\n",

    "description": "The noble Princess is looking for an ideal partner and confidant to help with her royal duties when she one day assumes the throne. You must prove your worth and gain her trust by enlisting allies, friends, and family of the Princess to carry a letter of intent to her. Can you earn the Princess\u0027 trust and become her confidant?\n\nPlaying cards one at a time, players in Love Letter use the abilities of these key people in the Princess\u0027 life to outwit their opponents and successfully deliver their letter and gain her favor. Players must utilize each character\u0027s special skill to avoid being caught and successfully deliver their letter to the Princess. Once a set number of favor tokens are acquired, that player wins and becomes the Princess\u0027 confidant.\n\nThis 2019 edition of Love Letter features new artwork by Citadels artist Andrew Bosley, screen-printed tokens, and two new characters (five cards in total) that allow for games with up to six players. When played, the Chancellor (value 6) allows you to draw two new cards, add those to your hand, then place two cards of your choice on the bottom of the deck. The Spy (value 0) wins you a favor token if you were the only player to play or discard a spy during the round.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers \u0026ndash; Meriwether Lewis and William Clark \u0026ndash; to discover this huge terra incognita.\n\nLewis \u0026 Clark is a board game in which each player manages an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.\n\nLewis \u0026 Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new \u0022handbuilding\u0022 mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.\n\nSince the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players\u0027 positions are crucial.\n\n",

Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest \u0027formation\u0027 of cards wins the flag.\n\nThis is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an \u0022advanced variant\u0022. Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.\n\nSome have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.  In the second edition of GMT\u0027s Battle Line the card quality is higher.\n\n",

Journey across islands, building huts where the resilient men and women of your tribes can settle, discovering fishing grounds and collecting shells. Send priests to the temples, and gather offerings to curry favor with the gods.\n\nIn Bora Bora, players use dice to perform a variety of actions using careful insight and tactical planning. The heart of the game is its action resolution system in which 5-7 actions are available each round, the exact number depending on the number of players. Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action. Place a high number on an action, and you\u0027ll generally get a better version of that action: more places to build, more choices of people to take, better positioning on the temple track, and so on. Place a low number and you\u0027ll get a worse action \u0026ndash; but you\u0027ll possibly block other players from taking the action at all as in order to take an action you must place a die on it with a lower number than any die already on the action.\n\nThree task tiles on a player\u0027s individual game board provide some direction as to what he might want to do, while god tiles allow for special actions and rule-breaking, as gods are wont to do. The player who best watches how the game develops and uses the most effective strategy will prevail.\n\n",

Players guide the development of their tribes across several generations\u0026mdash;from nomadic hunter-gatherers to prosperous tribal societies. Over the course of the game, tribes migrate and settle new lands, establish cultural traditions, hunt paleolithic megafauna, and build everlasting megalithic structures.\n\nEndless Winter is a euro-style game that combines worker placement and deck building in an innovative way. Each round, players send their tribe members to various action spaces, and pay for the actions by playing cards and spending resources. Tribe cards grant additional labor, while Culture cards provide a variety of unique effects. As an alternative, cards can be saved for an end-of-round Eclipse phase, where they are simultaneously revealed to determine the new player order, and trigger various bonus actions.\n\nThe game features a novel blend of interwoven systems and mechanisms, such as multi-use cards, area influence, tile placement, and set collection. Plus, there are many viable paths to victory. After four brisk rounds, scores are tallied, and the tribe with the most points wins!\n\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In the early 1900s, the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud established a revolutionary theory called psychoanalysis, related to the study of the unconscious mind. As his work took hold, supporters met at Freud\u0027s apartment every Wednesday to discuss psychology and dream symbolism. This group\u0026mdash;the Wednesday Psychological Society\u0026mdash;marked the beginning of the worldwide psychoanalytic movement. As a member of this society, you aim to formulate new therapeutic techniques, establish a practice, grow your clientele, and become Freud\u0026rsquo;s most distinguished contemporary. To best accomplish this, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to share insights, discuss ideas with peers, and publish theories. And to stay invigorated, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely need some coffee\u0026mdash;lots of coffee.\n\nUnconscious Mind is a euro-style game featuring worker placement, engine building, multiple rondels, and cascading effects. On your turn, you may place one or two Ideas (workers) on a central Meeting Table to access a variety of actions, such as adding tiles to your player board, drafting and playing cards, and moving around the city of Vienna. Where you place your Ideas also determines how far to advance your rondel\u0026rsquo;s inkpot, activating a row or column of tile effects on your player board.\n\nTo treat your clients and interpret their dreams, you must work with a supply of Insight resources, which you\u0026rsquo;ll manage on a multi-level dial. As you work through surface-level Manifest dreams into deep-seated Latent dreams, these Insights will help your clients reach catharsis. This is represented by lifting transparent layers from the client cards\u0026mdash;unlocking their ongoing special abilities and end-game scoring opportunities.\n\nOnce the group has solidified its reputation, the end of the game is signaled, and the member with the most points wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

After three ages of play, whoever has collected the most glory wins!\n\nIn more detail, the land of Ethnos contains twelve tribes of fantasy creatures, and in each game you choose six of them (five in a 2/3-player game), then create a deck with only the creatures in those tribes. The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos. Place three glory tokens in each region at random, arranging them from low to high.\n\nEach player starts the game with one card in hand, then 4-12 cards (double the number of players) are placed face up on the table. On a turn, a player either recruits an ally or plays a band of allies. In the former case, you take a face-up card (without replacing it from the deck) or the top card of the deck and add it to your hand. In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one token in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played.\n\nAt the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token. After the second age, the players with the most and second most tokens score glory equal to the values shown on the first and second tokens respectively. Players score similarly after the third age, then whoever has the most glory wins. (Games with two and three players last only two ages.)\n\n",

In a later game, a warlord might attempt to found a dynasty, creating a line of rulers that might last generations or be crushed by the rise of a terrible, arcane cult.\n\nIn Oath, there are no fancy production tricks, app-assisted mechanisms or production gimmicks. The game can be reset at any time and doesn\u0027t require the same play group from one game to the next. A player might use the fully-featured solo mode to play several generations during the week and then use that same copy of the game for Saturday game-night with friends. There are no scripted narratives or predetermined end points.

    "description": "Welcome to the Rococo era during the reign of Louis XV when it\u0026rsquo;s safe to say that holding lavish balls is quite trendy. Important personalities wrap up in noble coats and dresses, anxious to outshine one another. As the biggest event is coming up in just a few weeks, everyone is turning to you with their requests: an elegant coat here, a stunning dress there, or a donation to fund the fireworks at the event. Soon you realize that it\u0026rsquo;s not just about your dressmaking business anymore \u0026mdash; it\u0026rsquo;s about managing the most prestigious ball of the era\u0026hellip;and now it\u0026rsquo;s time to roc(k)!\n\nRococo is a Eurostyle board game with an interesting take on deck-building. Each turn you play one of your employee cards and let that employee perform a task: hire a new employee, buy resources, manufacture a coat or dress, or invest in the ball\u0026rsquo;s decorations. But not every employee is up to every task, so you must choose and lead your employees wisely \u0026mdash; especially since each employee grants a unique bonus and some of these bonuses generate prestige points.\n\nAfter seven rounds, the game ends with the big ball and a final scoring. Then you gain prestige points for certain employee bonuses and for coats and dresses that you rent out to guests at the ball as well as for decorations that you funded. The player who collected the most prestige points wins.\n\n",

    "description": "In The Witcher: Old World, you become a witcher \u0026mdash; a professional monster slayer \u0026mdash; and immerse yourself in the legendary universe of The Witcher franchise.\n\nSet years before the saga of Geralt of Rivia, The Witcher: Old World explores a time when monsters roamed the Continent in greater numbers, creating a constant peril that required the attention of expertly trained monster slayers, known as witchers. Five competing schools trained their adepts through brutal regimes, and once fully prepared, these now-recognized witchers set off to explore the land, seeking trouble and adventures and helping others for coin.\n\nIn this competitive adventure board game, 2-5 players travel across a vast map, embarking on masterfully penned quests, encountering and making ambiguous moral choices, fighting monsters \u0026mdash; and sometimes brawling with other witchers to defend their school\u0027s honor!\n\nThe game lets players construct their own unique decks of cards by choosing from a wide range of abilities: attacks, dodges, and witcher combat magic \u0026mdash; known as \u0022signs\u0022. Through card synergy, players aim to achieve powerful combos as they utilize their witcher school\u0027s hallmark abilities to their full potential. Quests, battles, and even dice poker allow each player to earn money, obtain new items, and train their skills.\n\nThe first player to acquire 4-6 trophies, with the number being set at the start of play, wins the game instantly. You can obtain trophies by killing monsters, instigating and winning chaotic tavern brawls against another witcher, training attributes to their highest level, and resolving certain quests throughout their adventure.\n\nThe game will include a Solo Mode that will allow for a solitaire adventure on the Continent.\n\n",

You build the tracks, upgrade towns, improve your train, and grab the right goods to make the longest, most profitable deliveries. Score your deliveries and add to your income or victory points, balancing your need to invest against your quest to win the game.\n\nSteam contains a beautiful, double-sided game board. The map on each side depicts terrain, towns, and cities at the start of the railway age. The map of the northeastern USA and neighboring Canada is ideal for 3 or 4 players. Use the map of Europe\u0027s lower Rhine and Ruhr region when playing a 4 or 5 player game. You can play Steam on any number of current and future variant and expansion maps, so we include pieces for 6 players.\n\nThe game plays very similarly to Age of Steam but with modifications to some of its mechanics and artwork. Tracks for income, train level, etc. are all printed on the board around the map such that alternate maps can be overlaid on the board and the necessary tracks will still be able to be used.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n     Railways of the World\n\n\n",

The goal being to catch the killer of the current case in the shortest time possible.\n\nUsing the Scan\u0026Play technology, each component (locations, characters, items, etc.) has a unique QR code, which, depending on the scenario selected, will activate and trigger different clues and stories. That means players will be able to get new stories way after the game is released simply by downloading the app\u0027s updates, without any shipping of new physical components involved.\n\nThe VR experience only requires a mobile phone. Players simply put the VR glasses (optional buy) onto their mobile device, and put the VR glasses on their nose, holding their mobile device in front of their eyes, to immerse themselves in the game\u0027s universe and search for clues in a virtual world.\n\nThe game comes with 1 tutorial and 5 scenarios, but more can be downloaded directly inside the app!\nEach session last around 1h to 1h30 minutes and many scenarios are connected to each others in order to tell a much bigger story.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

The video game from the small developer studio Toukana Interactive has been thrilling the gaming community since its Early Access in March 2021 and has already won all kinds of prestigious awards. Now Michael Palm and Lukas Zach are transforming the popular building strategy and puzzle game into a family game for young and old with Dorfromantik: The Board Game.\n\nIn Dorfromantik: The Board Game, up to six players work together to lay hexagonal tiles to create a beautiful landscape and try to fulfill the orders of the population, while at the same time laying as long a track and as long a river as possible, but also taking into account the flags that provide points in enclosed areas. The better the players manage to do this, the more points they can score at the end. In the course of the replayable campaign, the points earned can be used to unlock new tiles that are hidden in initially locked boxes. These pose new, additional tasks for the players and make it possible to raise the high score higher and higher.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Expand too rapidly, and unrest will bring your civilization to its knees; build up too slowly, however, and you might find yourself a mere footnote of history. As one of eight radically asymmetric civilizations, you will compete to become the most dominant empire the world has ever seen.\n\nImperium: Classics is a standalone game that contains the Carthaginian, Celt, Greek, Macedonian, Persian, Roman, Scythian, and Viking civilizations and an individual solo opponent behaving as each nation. It is also fully compatible with Imperium: Legends for players wanting to expand their pool of civilizations even further.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Grand adventures and strong fellowships are important and wonderful, but the first step of any journey is just as important as the last. With that in mind, it\u0026rsquo;s time to return to the beginning of one of the most epic adventures of all\u0026hellip;\n\nWith increased contents and some quality-of-life improvements, this new version of the classic LCG\u0026rsquo;s core set is the perfect opportunity for a new player to dive into the game.\n\nThe Revised Core Set includes cards to allow Campaign Mode (previous core set was strictly standalone scenarios), entirely new Boon and Burden mechanics that add cards that persist with the players from scenario to scenario, and full support for 4 players in the core box.\n\n-description from publisher\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat\u0027s new in this edition?\n     Support for up to four players with a single core set (the original core set supported only two players, meaning players needed two core sets to play with three or four players)\n     Three copies each of all 61 player cards from the original core set and eight copies of the Gandalf ally card (the original core set included only one or two copies of many of the player cards and only four copies of Gandalf)\n     A narrative campaign that links the three scenarios included in the core set into an overarching story\n     Quality-of-life improvements, such as new \u00223\u0022 and \u00225\u0022 numbered resource, progress and damage tokens\n     Revised \u0022Learn to Play\u0022 rulebook to allow new players to more easily jump right into playing, including two new decklists for players to try as a step up from the four included \u0022starter\u0022 decks\n\n\nThis set is 100% compatible with all previously-released The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game content.

    "description": "Cthulhu Wars is a strategy boardgame in which the players take the part of alien races and gods taken from the Cthulhu mythos created by H. P. Lovecraft. The game is physically large, and includes sixty-four  figurines of the cultists, monsters, aliens, and Great Old Ones that range in height from approximately 20 mm to nearly 180 mm.\n\nThe game takes place on a map of Earth. Each player takes the part of one of four factions included in the base game. At the start of a turn, players Gather Power, then, during a series of Action Rounds, they spend this Power to accomplish various tasks, such as recruiting Cultists, moving units, engaging in battle, summoning monsters, building Gates, casting spells, and Awakening their Great Old One. When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor *if* he has unlocked all six of spell books.\n\nDriving the strategy are a player\u0027s wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction\u0027s spell books. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books. All factions have multiple strategies open to them.\n\nThe base game supports 2-4 players (the map supports 5 players), but with new factions and maps released as expansions it can support up to 8 players.\n\n",

    "description": "The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.\n\nT.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of \u0022decksploration\u0022. Each player is free to give their character as deep a \u0022role\u0022 as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it\u0027s also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a \u0022run\u0022; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players\u0027 disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario\u0026rsquo;s obstacles.\n\nYou usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you\u0027ll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time.\n\nThe base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which \u0026mdash; Asylum \u0026mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120\u002B cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers. An insert allows players to \u0022save\u0022 the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it\u0027s possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.\n\n--description from the publisher\n\n",

    "name": "Lost Cities",
    "year": 1999,
    "description": "Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u0026ndash;10 in five different colors with three special \u0022handshakes\u0022 (\u0022HS\u0022 in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player\u0027s turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition\u0027s value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, \u0026times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8\u002B cards.\n\nScoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, \u0026times;2 for the multiplier.\n\n",

    "description": "Dixit Odyssey is both a standalone game and an expansion (Dixit: Odyssey (expansion)) for Jean-Louis Roubira\u0027s Dixit, which won Germany\u0027s Spiel des Jahres award in 2010.\n\nGame play in Dixit Odyssey matches that of Dixit: Each turn one player is the storyteller. This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this card\u0026mdash;but not too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller then lays out the cards, and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller. If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller\u0027s card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller. When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins.\n\nDixit Odyssey contains 84 new cards, each with a unique image drawn by Pier\u0026ocirc; and colored by Marie Cardouat, artist of Dixit and Dixit 2. The stand alone version also includes a folding game board, 6 new rabbit scoring tokens (12 total), and a box large enough to hold all the Dixit cards released to date. The stand alone version of Dixit Odyssey includes enough components for up to twelve players and also has variant rules for team play and for new ways to play with the cards.\n\nExpansion versus standalone versions of the game.\n\n     Standalone version is in a square box (released in 2011 but may still be available).\n     Expansion version is in a rectangular box (available from 2013 onwards): Dixit: Odyssey (expansion)\n\n\n",

    "description": "The greatest sorcerers of the kingdom have gathered at the heart of the Argos forest, where the legendary tournament of the 12 seasons is taking place. At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!\n\nSeasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:\n\nThe first phase \u0022Prelude\u0022 consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.\n\nOnce the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.\n\nNext comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players \u002B1).\n\nThese cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: \n- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) \n- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards\n- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. \n- Draw new cards\n\nEach player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the \u0022time track\u0022 would move forward.\nIn addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the \u0022exchange rates\u0022 of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.\n\nAt the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins.\n\n",

As brave explorers, cartographers and astronomers, players set off from Baghdad to map the surrounding land, waterways, and heavens above. Players must carefully manage their caravan of workers and equipment, while reporting back regularly to journal their findings at the House of Wisdom. Will you succeed in impressing the Caliph, or lose your way and succumb to the wilderness?\n\nThe aim of Wayfarers of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at the game\u0027s end. Points are primarily gained by mapping the land, water, and sky. Players can also gain points from upgrading their caravans, by gaining inspiration from nobles, and by influencing the three guilds of science, trade and exploration. As they make discoveries, players will want to quickly journal their progress. The game ends once one player\u0026rsquo;s marker has reached the far right column of the journal track.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player. On a player\u0027s turn, she chooses one of her cards, moves one of her pieces according to the chosen card, then replaces the card she used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of his cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card \u0026mdash; which is, of course, the card the first player just used.\n\nMoving onto one of the opponent\u0027s pawns removes that pawn from the game. Taking the opponent\u0027s main pawn, or moving your main pawn into your opponent\u0027s main pawn\u0027s starting space, wins you the game.\n\n",

    "description": "Cloudspire is 1-4 player strategy game heavily influenced by both tower defense and MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games. Solo and Cooperative play are driven by a scenario book that chronicles the story of the game from the perspective of each individual faction. Players control one of four unique factions in a battle to destroy and steal source energy from their opponents. Send and defend against armies and minions, build towers to protect your base, and explore with your heroes in search of resources and powerful Relics to turn the tide of battle.\n\nTaking place in the floating realm of Ankar, Cloudspire tells the story of a war to acquire a powerful and rare energy known only as \u0022the source.\u0022 Every race has their own unique units and heroes as well as the ability to bid and draft mercenaries for hire.\n\nArmies are placed either individually or in stacks to conceal powerful units until the last possible moments. Heroes, in the meantime, are controlled individually and may join the tide of battle or choose to explore points of interest in search of numerous resources. Meanwhile, the event deck regularly changes the terms of the fight, making every wave exciting and unpredictable.\n\nAs armies and minions approach opposing bases, they\u0027ll need to contend with Spires - powerful defense towers that can be built around the board. Fight for control of build sites and acquire new spire schematics to build an impenetrable defense and hold off the enemy. Upgrade your home base to unlock new strategies and abilities. Level up your heroes and lead your armies into battle with advanced and upgraded skills!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Judging by the smirk on the face of the Sultan of Solo, the businessman from North Sumatra has just made a mistake. And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan\u0026rsquo;s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash \u0026mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait \u0026mdash; what\u0026rsquo;s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook \u0026hellip; considerably, in fact \u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s see\u0026hellip;\n\nIndonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city\u0027s capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.\n\nPlayers keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.\n\n",

While there are many ways to earn money during a horse race, only the player that makes the most money will be declared the winner. Will you play it safe, or risk it big on a long shot?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces.\n\nArcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign.\n\nPlayers are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.\n\n",

    "name": "The Great Zimbabwe",
    "year": 2012,
    "description": "The Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa. It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.\n\nIn the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.\n\nHere\u0027s the flavour text from the rules:\n\nThe Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. \u0026ldquo;Oondabezitha \u0026rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, \u0026ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight\u0026rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. \u0026ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala\u0026rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. \u0026ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own\u0026rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...\n\n\nThe Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.\n\nBuying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in \u0027The Great Zimbabwe\u0027. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.\n\nClever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! \u0027The Great Zimbabwe\u0027 is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players\u0027 decisions change everything...\n\n",

    "description": "From the ashes of war, nations rise to power in the atomic age. Each player takes control of a nation struggling for power in the latter part of the 20th century. They build up their nation\u0026rsquo;s industry, commerce, and government by acquiring resources, building structures, and tapping sources of energy. The price of oil is going up, and nuclear energy is the wave of the future. The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire is set in the same \u0022universe\u0022 as The Manhattan Project, but it\u0027s a standalone game, not an expansion.\n\nThe major threat in Energy Empire is not war, but uncertain global impacts, that result from side effects of industrialization and pollution. Many actions come with a cost. So, as nations become more industrious, they also increase the amount of pollution in the environment.  Careful use of science can mitigate the harmful effects of industry, and can also help avert global crises.\n\nEnergy Empire uses worker placement, tableau-building, and resource management mechanics. On each turn, a player can choose to either work or generate. On a work turn, a player plays a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau. Players may spend energy to use an occupied space on the main board, so no spaces are ever completely blocked. On a generate turn, players get to renew their supply of energy by rolling \u0022energy dice\u0022 that represent nuclear, coal, oil, solar, and other forms of energy.\n\n",

Players take actions such as contracting workers, acquiring ships and buildings, sailing the seas, establishing colonies in discovered lands, trading goods on the market, and getting privileges.\n\nEach player starts with only two ships and three workers and tries to expand his wealth.\n\nThere are several lands that, once sailed to, allow players to found colonies. Colonies exist in different places where sugar, gold and spices are available and can be sold to the market to make some money. Money is used to build ships, erect buildings such as factories, shipyards and churches, and to get workers. Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.\n\nAt the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining their privileges with their achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.\n\n",

    "name": "Acquire",
    "year": 1963,
    "description": "In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.\n\nHistory of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\n\nMany books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of \u0022Vacations\u0022 from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called \u0022ACQUIRE.\u0022 3M\u0027s original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid\u0027s idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid\u0027s original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid\u0027s original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires.

Lloyd Solon\u0027s Rules help players to correct poor strategy during the beginning of the game that can been seen with new and unexperienced players (running out of money soon is the main mistake that must be omitted!).  \n2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board \u0026 tiles, redesigned stocks \u0026 money\n2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition.

It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson\u0027s original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.\n2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode \u0026mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus. \n2024 - The Renegade 60th Anniversary edition includes a set of plastic weighted poker chips, and Special Powers Variant cards.\n\n",

The player who succeeds in doing this best becomes the new \u0022Obermufti\u0022 of Marrakesh.\n\nMarrakesh is played over three rounds, with each round consisting of four turns. On each turn, players simultaneously and secretly choose three colored cylinders from behind their screen. Then, in turn order, they place matching colored assistants on their player board (these will be the actions they will perform later), then all cylinders are placed in the cube tower. The cube tower randomizes which cylinders are available this round, with some getting stuck and some from previous rounds coming out.\n\nIn turn order, players select a color and take 1-2 of the cylinders that have passed through the tower (or those that were stuck from a previous round but have now emerged) and place them on their player boards. These cylinders will enhance future actions taken in the same color in future rounds. Then, in turn order players will activate the regions where they have placed an assistant.\n\nActions allow players to gain wealth, which can be traded for influence in the city. Performing various actions also earns bonuses and enhances actions even more as the game proceeds. The player who scores the most points by the end of the game wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

With their bonds, they control the politics of the six imperial nations: Austria-Hungary, Italy, France, Great Britain, the German Empire, and Russia. The nations erect factories, build fleets, and deploy armies. The investors watch as their nations expand, wage wars, levy taxes, and collect the proceeds. Since the European nations are under the shifting influence of different investors, new strategic alliances and conflicts arise between them again and again!\n\nEach player represents an international investor. Only he who succeeds in increasing his capital and gaining influence in the most powerful European nations will win the imperial competition.\n\nImperial is a varied strategy game without the luck of dice or cards. Two to six players, from about twelve years and up, take on the role of imperial investors. The duration of the game is about two to three hours.\n\n",

Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette\u0027s hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!\n\nNumber 4 in the Setting: Tempest Shared World Game Series\n\n",

Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them \u0026ndash; but the profit is unbelievable.\n\nDungeon Petz is a standalone game set in the Dungeon Lords universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points.\n\n",

After each player, draw and perform cards from the heroes deck.\n\nYour goal as a team in every scenario is to survive the 2 waves of invading heroes by protecting the treasures on each room.

    "description": "Dead Reckoning is a game of exploration, piracy, and influence based in a Caribbean-esque setting. Each player commands a ship and crew and seeks to amass the greatest fortune. They do this through pirating, trading, treasure hunting, and (importantly) capturing and maintaining control over the uninhabited but resource-rich islands of the region. During the game, you can:\n\n\u0026bull; Customize your ship: Your ship is represented by a token on the board. The board starts mostly unexplored and will be revealed as you venture into uncharted waters. You also have a ship board where you load cargo and treasure, and you can customize the guns, speed, or holding space of your ship.\n\n\u0026bull; Card-craft your crew: You have a small deck of cards that will drive your actions in the game, with each card representing one of your crew members. This deck functions like one in a deck-building game, but the cards in the deck are sleeved, and rather than add new crew cards to your deck, you improve the skill and abilities of your crew cards by placing transparent \u0022advancement\u0022 cards in those sleeves. Aside from the transparent advancements, your crew will also \u0022level up\u0022 naturally during the game using a new card-leveling mechanism not seen in other card-crafting games such as Mystic Vale.\n\n\u0026bull; Control the region: The region is filled with many deserted islands. These islands are a major source of treasure, and players will battle for control of these islands.\n\n\u0026bull; Battle via a dynamic cube-tower: You can battle other players\u0027 ships or NPC merchant ships, and these battles are resolved via a new take on what a cube tower can be, with crew cards and ship powers increasing your chances of victory.\n\n\u0026bull; Uncover secrets of the sea: Expansions for Dead Reckoning use a \u0022saga\u0022 system in which certain content remains hidden and is discovered and added to the game organically only via playing. Rather than add everything at once, you gradually add it by playing and discovering. Depending on luck and player choice, less or more new content may get added each game.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.\n\nSurvive is very similar to Escape from Atlantis with some key differences.\n\nSurvive was reprinted as \u0022Survive: Escape from Atlantis!\u0022 by publisher Stronghold Games and hit store shelves in February, 2011.   The reprint contains the game Survive, as well as all the extra pieces needed in order to play the game as \u0022Escape from Atlantis\u0022 and is actually found here: Survive: Escape from Atlantis! because it came with the dolphins and dive dice which were removed from the anniversary edition which was released a couple of years later (though they were later made available by themselves for owners of that version).\n\n\u0022Survive: Escape from Atlantis!\u0022 is game #2 in the Stronghold Games \u0022Survive Line\u0022.\n\n",

The missions last just 10 real-time minutes (hyperspace jump, sector scan, hyperspace jump back) and the only task the players have is to protect their ship.\n\nDuring play, the central computer will announce the presence of various threats on one of the supplied 10 minute soundtracks that also acts as a game timer. The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.\n\nThe game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.\n\n(Based on a description from Czech Games Edition)\n\n",

These bankers became the wealthiest private individuals ever as they guided Europe into the modern age.\n\nAs a Renaissance banker, you will finance kings or republics, sponsor voyages of discovery, join secret cabals, or unleash jihads and inquisitions. Your choices determine if Europe is elevated into the bright modern era or remains festering in dark feudalism. Four victories determine the future course of Western Society: will it be towards imperialism, trade globalization, religious totalitarianism, or enlightened art and science?\n\nNew components include punchouts for pirate ships, pawns for concessions and serfs, placards for player boards, and empire squares allowing storage of repressed tokens and queens even if the King is not in a player Tableau.\n\nExtra game Map Cards are included, allowing the mounted gameboard to be left behind for small game portability. Useful if you have limited space in your game bag.\n\nExpanded rules include Dalmatians, Cryptography, Condottiere, apostasy, and the solitaire game. Strategy and Frequently-Asked Questions are included.\n\nContains Pax Renaissance Expansion and Pax Renaissance: BGG Promo Pack.\n\n",

Take on the role of a colonial power seeking fame, glory, and riches in the New World.  As you proceed through three ages, you can launch expeditions of discovery, colonize regions, expand your merchant fleet, build capitol buildings that give your nation distinct advantages, develop your economy, and, if necessary, declare war.\n\nThough originally published for 5 players, the game is playable by 6 with the original components and board configuration with addition of a set of figures in another color.  This was originally offered as an \u0022expansion\u0022 and an incentive to pre-order the game. A 6 player expansion is also in the Glenn Drover\u0027s Empires: Builder Expansion, along with new capital buildings and National Advantage tiles.\n\nNot to be confused with Age of Discovery.\n\n",

For the expansion to regular Power Grid see Power Grid: Europe/North America.\n\nFor the 10th anniversary of the highly successful game Power Grid we present this new deluxe version including brand new components. Wait for a huge double-sided game board presenting Europe and North America, newly customized wooden parts and an entire deck of new power plants, some of which use natural gas instead of garbage. New overview cards for the resource refill improve game play. An exciting new two players experience is also added - \u0026ldquo;Against the Trust\u0026rdquo;!\n\nThe game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-wracking resource speculations, city networks and the competition among the players, all the way to the tight game ending with several players fighting for the win.\n\nThe goal of Power Grid Deluxe is to supply the most cities with power when someone\u0027s network reaches a predetermined size. Players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they need to power these cities. However, as power plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you\u0027re potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nWhat\u0027s more, players must acquire the resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the \u0022renewable\u0022 windfarm plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\nNOTE: The deluxe edition came with Power Grid: The New Power Plants \u2013 Set 2, which was later released separately in 2021.\n\n",

    "description": "Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.\n\nIn the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.\n\nAs with Agricola, Caverna, and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space \u0026mdash; which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you\u0027ve visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don\u0027t take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.\n\n",

    "description": "The game Glass Road commemorates the 700-year-old tradition of glass-making in the Bavarian Forest. (Today, the \u0022Glass Road\u0022 is a route through the Bavarian forest that takes visitors to many of the old glass houses and museums of that region.) You must skillfully manage your glass and brick production in order to build the right structures that help you keep your business flowing. Cut the forest to keep the fires burning in the ovens, and spread and remove ponds, pits, and groves to supply yourself with the items you need. Fifteen specialists are there at your side to carry out your orders...\n\nIn more detail, the game consists of four building periods. Each player has an identical set of fifteen specialist cards, and each specialist comes with two abilities. At the beginning of each building period, you choose a hand of five specialists. If during this building period, you play a specialist that no other player has in hand, you may use both abilities on that card; if two or more players play the same specialist, each of them may use only one of the two abilities. Exploiting the abilities of these specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings, which come in three types:\n\n\n    Processing buildings\n    \u0022Immediate\u0022 buildings with a one-time effect \n    Buildings that provide bonus points at the end of the game for various accomplishments\n\n\nMastering the balance of knowing the best specialist card to play and being flexible about when you play it \u0026mdash; together with assembling a clever combination of buildings \u0026mdash; is the key to this game.\n\nThe 2021 edition of Glass Road includes previously released promotional material: the Oktoberfest and Adventskalender tiles and the Harlekin card for use in the solitaire version of the game.\n\n",

In this game, you build a civilization using only cards; there\u0027s no map, no tokens, no dice, no pieces. The game\u0027s 105 innovations \u0026mdash; or in the fourth edition, 115 innovations \u0026mdash; are each represented by a card with a unique effect, organized into ten (or eleven) ages. Each innovation\u0027s effect is tied thematically to its identity, allowing you to either elevate your society or attack your opponents.\n\nIn addition to directly affecting your opponents, you can share in the effects of their technologies if you amass enough visible icons on your board. Strategically building your tableau of cards to share often and defend against demands is crucial to success.\n\nTo win, you must claim achievements, which you can attain by amassing points or by meeting certain criteria with the innovations you have built. No two games of Innovation play the same way.\n\n[Admin note: The specific card effects have changed across the four editions of Innovation, in addition to age 11 being added in the fourth edition, but the core gameplay has remained consistent across all editions, so all editions are listed on a single page in the database.]\n\n",

On a turn, a player chooses one of his cards and performs an action, with six different actions being available: Take workers, take money, mitigate a threat, build a canal, build a house, or hire the character depicted on the card. In principle, every card can be used for every action \u0026ndash; but the color of the card determines in which areas the actions can be used or the strength of the chosen action, e.g., blue cards provide blue workers and red cards help mitigate red threats. All of the action is geared toward the gathering of prestige, with the most prestigious merchant winning in the end.\n\n",

The game revolves around an innovative dice-rolling combo mechanic. The number of dice you roll is determined by the strength of your galaxy. Each die is engraved with symbols representing the various actions you can take, such as moving a spaceship, increasing your culture or energy resources, or advancing your political or economic influence over newly discovered planets.\n\nThrough careful planning, you must make the most out of your turn, taking the available actions in whichever order you consider most beneficial. But be careful, as each of your opponents can choose to follow each action you take by expending valuable resources. This means that it can always be your turn, even when it is someone else\u0026rsquo;s turn!\n\nPlayers will colonize new planets throughout the game, thereby earning victory points and accumulating special abilities which they can activate for their galactic empire. Careful spending of resources will ensure the fastest growth of your empire, while allowing you to receive the biggest possible pay\u2010off from the actions you take.\n\nWill your influence be enough to control the most powerful planets in the galaxy?

    "description": "The King\u0027s Dilemma is an interactive narrative experience with legacy elements, featuring several branching storylines leading to many possible finales and an evolving deck of event cards at its core. Players represent the various houses leading the government of the Kingdom of Ankist.\n\nYou will draw one card from the \u0022Dilemma deck\u0022 each round and experience the game story as it unfolds. Each card poses a problem that the Council has to resolve on the King\u0027s behalf. As members of the King\u0027s inner circle, your decisions determine how the story proceeds and the fate of the kingdom. Each event happens only once: You discuss and bargain with the other players, then finally you make a choice, determining the outcome, progressing the game story, and possibly unlocking more events.\n\nYou have to keep the kingdom going, while also seeking an advantage for your own house; this power struggle may lead the kingdom into war, famine, or riot, or it could generate wealth and well-being. This will depend on your choices! The thing is, each decision has consequences, and what is good for the kingdom as a whole may be bad for your family...\n\nWill you act for the greater good, or will you think only of yourself?\n\n",

    "description": "The sequel to Scythe sends players on a new adventure into Siberia, where a massive meteorite crashed near the Tunguska River, awakening ancient corruption. An expedition led by Dr. Tarkovsky ventures into the taiga to learn about the meteorite and its impact on the land. Itching for adventure, heroes from the war privately fund their own expeditions to Siberia, hoping to find artifacts, overcome challenges, and ultimately achieve glory. Expeditions has completely different mechanisms than Scythe, though the goal was to capture some of the same feelings that Scythe evokes, with a slightly darker, more supernatural theme.\n\nExpeditions is a competitive, card-driven, engine-building game of exploration. Play cards to gain power, guile, and unique worker abilities; move your mech to mysterious locations and gain cards found among the tiles; use workers, items, meteorites, and quests to enhance your mech; and use power and guile to vanquish corruption.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

You\u0026nbsp;can recreate Mr. Walton\u0027s murder in so many different ways that you won\u0027t ever play two similar games! (Mr. Walton will not thank you for doing this.)\n\nThe game challenges you to use\u0026nbsp;genuine detective abilities\u0026nbsp;to solve each case. To solve a mystery, you have to interrogate the suspects, question the household staff, examine the crime scene, search for clues around the Walton Mansion, and consult the police reports. You will do all of this while exchanging information with your opponents or hiding it from them, so get ready to use all your\u0026nbsp;gumshoe skills!\n\nWHO killed Mr. Walton?\nHOW did the murderer end his life?\nWHY did the murderer kill him?\nWas there an ACCOMPLICE?\n\nThe heart of Awkward Guests is simple: Players have a hand of six cards, and each card has a value (1, 2 or 3 points, according to the amount of information that it provides) and several references (i.e., the subjects of the card information). During a turn, you ask for information about two different references in which you are interested. The rest of the players can offer you cards that contain the requested references, and you can trade for those cards by giving the offering players the same number of points they have offered via cards in your hand.\n\nAfter each round ends, players can try to solve the mystery. If the mystery is not solved, players discard part of their hands and receive three new cards. The player or players who solve the mystery first win.\n\n",

    "description": "Imperial 2030 is a game on its own, based on the rules of Imperial.  The six powers (USA, Europe, Russia, China, India, and Brazil) develop their industrial basis and build up armies and fleets.  They fight over control of neutral land and sea areas in order to become the most powerful nation worldwide.\n\nIn this game it is not the players who take turns, but the six powers, one after another.  The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation\u0027s government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.  Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!\n\nImperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games. Compared to \u0022Imperial\u0022 there will be some new features:\n- new wooden bits\n- the Swiss Bank \n- a new 30 million bond to invest in\n- more neutral territory, generating higher taxation\n- fewer home provinces\n- control of canals (Panama and Suez).\n\nFor those who already owned Imperial, there was the opportunity to get only the new map and bonds at Essen \u002709, as it can be played with the old wooden bits as well.\n\n",

Their duty is to effectively manage both its infrastructure and citizens. The core gameplay will be brutal, challenging, and complex, but easy to learn. The citizens won\u0026rsquo;t just be speechless pieces on the board. Society members will issue demands and react accordingly to the current mood, so every decision and action bears consequences.\n\nThe players will decide the fate of their people. Will you treat them like another resource? Are you going to be an inspiring builder, a fearless explorer, or a bright scientist? Is your rule going to be a sting of tyranny or an era of law and equality?\n\nThe game is based on a bestseller video game by 11bit studios, the creators of This War Of Mine. The original (digital) edition of Frostpunk is a highly successful strategy-survival-city-builder, a BAFTA-nominee that originally launched in 2018.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Artisan dragons, the smaller and magically talented versions of their larger (and destructive) cousins, are sought by shopkeepers so that they may delight customers with their flamecraft. You are a Flamekeeper, skilled in the art of conversing with dragons, placing them in their ideal home and using enchantments to entice them to produce wondrous things. Your reputation will grow as you aid the dragons and shopkeepers, and the Flamekeeper with the most reputation will be known as the Master of Flamecraft.\n\nIn Flamecraft, 1-5 players take on the role of Flamekeepers, gathering items, placing dragons and casting enchantments to enhance the shops of the town. Dragons are specialized (bread, meat, iron, crystal, plant and potion) and the Flamekeepers know which shops are the best home for each. Visit a shop to gain items and a favor from one of the dragons there.  Gathered items can be used to enchant a shop, gaining reputation and the favors of all the dragons in the shop. If you are fortunate enough to attract fancy dragons then you will have opportunities to secure even more reputation.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant is a singularly unique trading and negotiation game for 4-9 players. Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you\u0027ll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.\n\nEach player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture\u0027s economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture\u0027s outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.\n\nEach game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race\u0027s special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.\n\nThe ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.\n\nThe game is almost all simultaneous play.\n\nSidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.\n\n",

These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race\u0027s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.\n\nThe Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:\n\n\n     Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!\n     Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!\n     Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!\n     Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!\n     Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!\n     Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines! \n\n\nStrategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.\n\nVictory can come only from the death of your opponent\u0027s Summoner...\n\n",

Yet, despite their fortifications and imposing armies, rumours began spreading of a formidable foe in the lands above the Black Sea. They came on horseback. Fierce warriors, both male and female. Skilled with the sword, axe and bow. But they weren\u0026rsquo;t mindless savages. Their artisans were renowned for their ability to craft detailed trinkets of gold. They fashioned leather armour and improvised the recurve bow. They trained eagles for hunting and war. Some even believe they inspired the Greek tales of the Amazons. But they were more than legend or fable. They were the Raiders of Scythia.\n\nThe aim of Raiders of Scythia is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game\u0026rsquo;s end. VP are gained by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and completing Quests. Players will need to assemble a Crew, train Animals and gather Provisions. The game ends when there is only 2 unraided Settlements or 2 Quests remaining on the Main Board.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

This game is set in a dark medieval-fantasy universe.\n\nThe Destinies system offers a fully story-driven, app-supported, RPG-like board game experience, without the need for a game master. Each scenario depicts a part of a vivid world, full of dark stories, epic NPCs and mysteries to solve. Each player takes the role of a hero on a quest to fulfill their destiny. Each destiny is a final goal of the character and has at least two, completely different paths to victory, composed of branching series of quests. Players compete with each other to push the world towards their own destiny.\n\nThe game uses an app and the Scan\u0026Play technology to offer players a unique story-driven experience full of dynamic events, epic adventures, and an ever-changing game world. Each turn players discover new parts of the world presented on tiles, explore them and pick one point of interest to visit. There they learn more about the story and make crucial choices of how they want to interact with people, creatures or situations faced there. The consequences of each choice are meaningful and often change the state of the world forever.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the designer\n\n",

This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.\n\nAlien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.\n\nThe game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system\u0026rsquo;s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.\n\nThe planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.\n\nWinning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?\n\nRoll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don\u0027t dream it\u0027ll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.\n\n",

    "description": "In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.\n\nDesigned by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.\n\nPicking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!\n\nOn each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go \u0022into decline\u0022. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.\n\nAt the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.\n\nClarifications: available in a pinned forum post.\n\n",

    "description": "Furnace is an engine-building Eurogame in which players take on the roles of 19th-century capitalists building their industrial corporations and aspiring to make as much money as they can by purchasing companies, extracting resources, and processing them in the best combinations possible.\n\nEach player starts the game with a random start-up card, the resources depicted at the top of that card, and four colored discs valued 1-4.\n\nThe game is played over four rounds, and each round consists of two phases: Auction and Production. During the auction, 6-8 company cards are laid out with their basic sides face up. Players take turns placing one of their discs on one of these cards, but you cannot place a disc on a card if a disc of the same value or color is already present. Thus, you\u0027ll place discs on four cards.\n\nOnce all the discs are placed, the cards are resolved from left to right. Whoever placed the highest-valued disc will claim this card, but first anyone with a lower-valued disc on this card will gain compensation, either the resources depicted multiplied by the value of their disc or a processing ability (exchange X for Y) up to as many times as the value of their disc.\n\nOnce all the cards have been claimed or discarded, players enter the production phase, using their cards in the order of their choice. Each company card has one action \u0026mdash; either production or processing \u0026mdash; on its basic side and two actions on its upgraded side. During the production phase, you can use each of your cards once to gain resources, process those resources into other resources or money, and upgrade your cards.\n\nAt the end of four rounds, whoever has the most money wins.\n\nFurnace also includes capitalist cards that contain unique effects, and if you want, you can choose to deal one out to each player at the start of the game. For an additional challenge, you can require players to create a \u0022production chain\u0022, with each newly acquired company card being placed somewhere in that chain and locked in position for the remainder of the game.\n\n",

    "description": "Neuroshima Hex! is a strategy game set in the post-apocalyptic world of Neuroshima, a Polish role-playing game. Each player leads one of four armies: Borgo, Hegemonia (Hegemony), Moloch, and Posterunek (Outpost). Each army deck consists of 34 tiles: soldiers, support tiles, and special actions. You win when all enemy headquarters are destroyed or when your headquarters is the least damaged at the end of the game.\n\n\n     In 2007 and 2013, the game had graphical facelifts, somewhat modifying the iconography. Note: each army (whether base game or expansion) is compatible with every version (1.0, 2.x, 3.0). Only the art styles and icon graphics differ mildly.\n     The game had different editions with different components/bonuses alongside the 4 base armies (big board, bonus army, puzzles, etc.). See different editions for details.\n     Tile width and thickness strongly varied depending on edition, and even on a same editor slightly varied over the years. This does not affect play, but may affect some storage solutions.\n\n\n Due to multiple versions and expansions, see the Neuroshima Hex! english FAQ\n The game is also expanded by Unofficial Neuroshima Hex! expansions, available here on BGG.\n\nNote:  There is no solitaire bot/AI/system to compete against. The only options for \u0022solo\u0022 play are soloing multiple factions yourself, or solving puzzles (like Chess checkmate problems) available in some editions and expansions.\n\n",

    "description": "During the reign of Emperor Yao, the people of ancient China were constantly plagued by deadly floods along the Yellow River. Eager to put an end to the devastation, Yao selected Gun, one of his officials, to devise a plan. After nine years of failed attempts using dams and dikes, Gun\u0027s employment came to a questionable end. After his passing, Yu inherited his father\u0027s work. Learning from Gun\u0027s failures, Yu set out to construct a series of canals to direct the surging river into nearby fields and smaller waterways.\n\nLegacy of Yu is a solo-only, fully-resettable, nonlinear campaign game in which you step into the role of the legendary hero of the Xia Dynasty, Yu the Great. It will be your job to build the canals ahead of the impending flood, while also defending your growing village against neighboring barbarian tribes. With each game, stories will be shared and new gameplay elements added. The campaign features a self-balancing system which adapts to how well you are doing. The campaign ends once you either win or lose seven games.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Merchants \u0026 Marauders lets you live the life of an influential merchant or a dreaded pirate in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering.  Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?\n\nIn Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 \u0022glory\u0022 points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there\u0027s some uncertainty about when the game will end.\n\nA big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn \u0022pirate\u0022 or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it\u0027s possible to come back from defeat.\n\n",

The residents of the cities, however, took the bonfires for granted and exploited them for their personal gain. Disappointed the guardians of light retreated and let the bonfires extinguish. The citizens could no longer live in the now dark cities and were forced to leave.\n\nYou are a group of gnomes living close to the cities and you also need the light of the bonfires. Missing it now, you try yourself to visit the cities and learn how to ignite the bonfires once again: You must visit the guardians of light on their holy islands and ask for tasks to prove your good will. For each completed task, they will re-ignite one extinguished bonfire. Whoever manages to earn the greatest trust from the guardians and manages to brighten their city the most will win the game.\n\nThe engine for Bonfire are the three-coloured tiles you will be puzzling onto your player board. When you manage to place the same colours adjacent to one another, you will receive more action tiles of that specific kind. This will allow you to specialize in certain types of actions and pursue different strategies. \nYou can use the tiles to perform the following actions: \n\n     Move your ship to an island \n     Receive a task from an island by spending two resources \n     Invite a guardian of light into your city \n     Trigger a procession of guardians through your city and gain resources. \n     Add a landscape tile to your city (this is where the processions take place) \n     Recruit a gnome gaining a special ability or victory points \n     Find support by the last bonfire, gaining portals, resources or action tiles \n\n\nYou will play in turn order until a fixed number of tasks has been solved, after which each player has 5 more turns. During final scoring, you will receive points for your completed tasks (the bonfires) and any improvements made there (portals, landscapes or guardians).\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.\n\nThen you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.\n\nWith any luck, you\u0027ll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.\n\nAbove and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they\u0027ve been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?\n\nA great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You\u0027ll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you\u0027re willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.\n\nAt the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!\n\nThe Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:\n\n     Villager Tool tokens\n     Lost Villagers\n     Swamp Villagers\n     Exclusive Stretch goals:\n     Creature Villagers\n     Quest Tokens\n     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book\n     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book \n     Wooden Goods\n\n\nThis collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives\n\n",

Outwit your opponent in a fascinating tactical duel in which having the best cards and playing them at the wrong time can be deadly for yourself.\n\nCards in Mindbug represent weird creatures that all come with unique and powerful abilities such as a Compost Dragon, a Snail Hydra, or a Kangasaurus Rex. Each player starts the game with ten creature cards (five in hand and five in a draw pile) and tries to use them to reduce the opponent\u0027s life total to zero. In addition, every player receives two Mindbug cards that can be used to mind control an opposing creature when it is played. This innovative Mindbug mechanism is the core of the game and leads to a unique decision-making process that makes Mindbug feel utterly different from any other card game.\n\nPlaying a card doesn\u0027t require any resources in Mindbug. As a result, the game has no ramp-up phase (such as gathering resources) and doesn\u0027t require weak cards. Since there is also no deck-building, you can start playing right away from a single deck. There is also no unfair advantage as players draw cards from the same deck and always get the chance to mind control the strongest opposing cards. In the end, it all comes down to your own decisions, making the game extremely fair and competitive at the same time.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Up to two thousand pounds in weight and over ten feet tall, the bear is considered the biggest and heaviest terrestrial carnivore in the world. Of course, there is not just \u0022one bear;\u0022 on the contrary, there are plenty of subspecies that differ from each other in various aspects. For instance, only the Kodiak bear (ursus arctos middendorffi) weighs about 2,000 lbs. The polar bear (ursus maritimus) weighs \u0022only\u0022 1,100 lbs., but gets much bigger than the Kodiak bear, being as much as 11 ft. tall!\n\nB\u0026auml;renpark takes you into the world of bears, challenging you to build your own bear park. Would you like another polar bear enclosure or rather a koala* house? The park visitors are sure to get hungry on their tour through the park, so build them places to eat! Whatever your choices are, make sure you get the next building permit and use your land wisely! (* No, koalas aren\u0027t bears but they\u0027re so cute, we couldn\u0027t leave them out of this game!)\n\nIn more detail, each player in B\u0026auml;renpark builds their own bear park, attempting to make it as beautiful as they can, while also using every square meter possible. The park is created by combining polyomino tiles onto a grid, with players scoring for animal houses, outdoor areas, completed construction, and more. The sooner you build it, the better! Cover icons to get new tiles and park sections. The game ends as soon as one player has finished expanding their park, then players tally their points to see who has won.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Each player other than the storyteller then secretly guesses which card belongs to the storyteller. If nobody or everybody guesses the correct card, the storyteller scores 0 points, and each other player scores 2 points. Otherwise, the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3 points. Additionally, the non-storyteller players score 1 point for every vote received by their card.\n\nThe game ends when the deck is empty or if a player has scored at least 30 points. In either case, the player with the most points wins.\n\nThe Dixit base game and each expansion contain 84 cards, and the cards can be mixed together as desired.\n\n",

(Note that this set is solely for two players, but it can be combined with other sets, which all serve up to four players.) Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you\u0027ve mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.\n\nRobin Hood vs. Bigfoot features the titular heroes. Robin Hood and his outlaws excel at ranged attacks and robbing from their opponents. Bigfoot and his pal, the Jackalope, crash through the forest for quick attacks before disappearing like a figment of the mind.\n\nCombat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card\u0027s unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhauser for ranged attacks and area effects.\n\nThe game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that\u0027s brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.\n\n",

This game is unrelated to the similarly named 2002 Eagle Games Sid Meier\u0027s Civilization: The Boardgame.\n\nFrom Press Release:\n\nBefore you lies a vast bounty of land, ripe for the plucking. Your meager beginnings will influence the paths you must take. Lead your people well and they will take you to infinite heights of greatness. If civilization manages to endure the ages, your name will hang in every whisper of its legacy...\n\nFantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s Civilization: The Board Game! Forge an empire to stand the test of time using innovative game mechanics with multiple paths to victory.\n\nWill you lead the greatest army in the world to conquer your foes? Or will you be the first to journey to the stars, becoming the most technologically advanced civilization known to man? The choice is yours.\n\nDesigned by Kevin Wilson, Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people\u0026rsquo;s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.\n\nIn Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!\n\nFans of Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s classic video game franchise will find familiar footing in Civilization: The Board Game. Staying true to the foundations of its video game predecessor while creating a new and unique way to play, Civilization: The Board Game captures the spirit and grandeur of carving out a magnificent empire from modest beginnings.\n\nPlayers start off with a single city, one army figure, and one scout, and from these meager origins you must forge through the ages and become the greatest civilization in the world.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the video game series will find Civilization: The Board Game a great way to enter into the world of Civilization. The strategy and tactical decisions involved in Civilization: The Board Game will appeal to strategy gamers and war gamers alike, and the ability to win through culture and technological advancement will give those who only wish to focus on their own empire a chance at victory as well.\n\n",

    "description": "With technology rapidly developing and the human population growing, Victorian-era Earth is in dire need of fuel, land, and other natural resources. Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.\n\nAs the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy \u0026ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet\u0027s most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.\n\nIn each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they\u0027ll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game\u0027s end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.\n\nThe 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:\n\n\n    Components for up to six players instead of five\n    Special two-player variant rules\n    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards\n    Mars\u0027 moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself\n\n\n",

    "year": 2020,
    "description": "Four millennia ago on the eastern bank of the Nile river was laid the foundation of the Temple of Amun-Ra. Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as \u0022The Most Select of Places\u0022 (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.\n\nJoin ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.\n\nThe game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun\u0027s rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.\n\nThe game takes place over multiple rounds. Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk\u0027s shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.\n\nAs you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice \u0026mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section \u0026mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.\n\nWhen you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!\n\nTwo scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.\n\n",

One player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The other players are police detectives who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game. The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel\u0027s streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.\n\n",

    "description": "Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes. Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.\n\nThe deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.\n\nWhen the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn\u0027t have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\n",

Humans have exhausted the resources that the Earth offered them, and humanity must now develop cities that maintain a delicate balance between resource production and consumption. Habitable space is scarce, however, and mankind must now face the challenge of building ever upwards. To develop this new type of city, you will gather a team of experts around you, and try to become the best urban planner for Ginkgopolis.\n\nIn  Ginkgopolis, the city tiles come in three colors: yellow, which provides victory points; red, which provides resources; and blue, which provides new city tiles. Some tiles start in play, and they\u0027re surrounded by letter markers that show where new tiles can be placed.\n\nBegin with three Character cards which grant you starting resources and bonuses to power your game actions. On a turn, each player chooses a Construction or Urbanization card from his hand simultaneously. Players reveal these cards, adding new tiles to the border of the city in the appropriate location or placing tiles on top of existing tiles. Each card in your hand that you don\u0027t play is passed on to your left-hand neighbor, so keep in mind how your play might set up theirs!\n\nWhen you build over a tile, you add its \u0026ldquo;power\u0022 card to your tableau, which provides you additional abilities during the game, allowing you to scale up your building and point-scoring efforts.\n\n",

And has it ever occurred to you how hard it actually is to build and manage such underground complex filled with corridors and creatures? No? Well now you can try.

Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc.  Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g. mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot).\nWhen using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn.\n\nThere are 4 turns to place actions for each game \u0022year\u0022 and two game years in a whole game.\nEach turn is identified as a \u0022season\u0022.  Each season, players will get to see the heroes and events to come in the following season.  Thus allowing them to prepare.\n\nAt the end of each season (after the first), heroes will be allocated to each player according to their level of evil.  Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves.  Each hero has their own power for which the player needs to prepare for.\nFinally, at the end of each year, the heroes will travel down into the dungeon to fight.\n\nScoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured.\n\n",

    "description": "Maria is a game based on the War of the Austrian Succession, between 1740 and 1748, where Austria was attacked by Prussia, France, Bavaria and Saxony, while only Great Britain, Hanover and the Netherlands (by forming the so-called Pragmatic Army) helped her.\n\nMaria is primarily a 3 player game. One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria\u0027s enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria\u0027s ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.\n\nMaria is derived from the award-winning Friedrich: Anniversary Edition, but has its very own character, including politics, hussars, force marches, imperial election, Saxony\u0027s betrayal and Prussia\u0027s annexation of Silesia. Subtle maneuvers, seizure of fortresses, prudent retreats, and Machiavellian politics are the keys to victory. However, players must be careful: whoever uses his Tactical Cards unwisely in battle can suddenly find himself not on the highway to glory but on the road to ruin.\n\nMaria takes you to the era of the 18th century\u0027s ruthless struggle for power. It can be played in 2 variants: the shorter, simplified introductory game or the longer but richer advanced game, with its simultaneous campaigns in Bohemia and Flanders.\n\n",

Why don\u0027t we start farming olives, like our neighbors?\u0022\n\nThe cart-driver nods: \u0022Ever since them city folks started worshiping San Giorgio I have to travel further and further to new building sites. I\u0027m on my way now to the new inn they built. I\u0027ll change horses there and deliver this load,\u0022 he gestures towards the pile of wood in the cart with his head \u0022to the sea beyond. Gonna start some fisheries there. It is said we\u0027ll conquer those olive-farmers before long. But their land is even more polluted than ours.\u0022\n\nThe farmer nods his head in reply. As the cart starts moving again, he returns to the field to harvest the last bushels of grain, growing between the stumps of what used to be a lush forest -- three turns ago.\n\nAntiquity is a strategy game for 2-4 players. It is set in an environment loosely modeled on Italy in the late Middle Ages. Players choose their own victory condition: they can focus on population growth, trade, conquest, or city building by choosing their patron saint.\n\nEach strategy requires a completely different style of play. Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all -- but you\u0027ll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player.\n\nWhile your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials -- until finally, there is no more land left to farm. Let\u0027s hope one of you has won the game before that time!\n\n",

To achieve this, players must develop on three levels: first by collecting allies, then using them to recruit Lords of the Abyss, who will then grant access to different parts of the city. Players acquire cards through a draft of sorts, and the Lords of the Abyss acquired on those cards grant special powers to the cardholder \u0026mdash; but once you use the cards to acquire a location, that power is shut off, so players need to time their land grabs well in order to put themselves in the best position for when the game ends.\n\n",

The game of Arydia is built on four design pillars: Exploration, Progression, Combat, and Role-playing.\n\n\n    Exploration \u0026mdash; Make your way across the world map, discovering new locations, interacting with memorable characters, fighting vicious monsters, and scavenging long-lost treasures. The world pulls you in through detailed descriptions and artwork for each place you visit. Every location is unique, not randomized, and is built piece by piece as you explore.\n\n\n\n    Progression \u0026mdash; Arydia is played as a campaign over the course of a number of game sessions; you start each session right where you left off! As you play, the game keeps track of your actions and decisions. Your characters will grow in power, collecting new items, weapons, and skills. NPCs and locations will change, depending on how you interact with them. All of this progression is done using a simple, but powerful, index system, which allows for quick and easy set-up and tear down.\n\n\n\n    Combat \u0026mdash; Arydia features a tactical, co-operative combat system. Enemies are controlled by game cards and dice, while you and your companions work together to defeat them.\n\n\n\n    Role-playing \u0026mdash; Take on the roles of a wide cast of characters as you encounter them throughout your journeys. The incentive-based role-play system encourages you to engage in dramatic storytelling, without being intrusive.\n\n\nAs a \u0022green legacy\u0022 game, Arydia features all the hallmarks of a legacy game \u0026mdash; packages to open, hidden information, progression, discovery, exploration \u0026mdash; but allows you to reset the game when you have completed it so that you can start again or pass it on to someone else.\n\n",

    "description": "Feed the Kraken is a hidden role deduction game, with three asymmetric factions. All players may be sitting in the same boat, but they want to navigate in different directions! The loyal sailors must bring the ship safely to mainland, whereas the pirates crave to secretly maneuver the ship into the Bermuda Triangle. Meanwhile a crazy cultist is busy convincing parts of the crew to help him summon their dark lord \u0026mdash;the Kraken\u0026mdash; from the depth of the sea to save them all.\n\nThe goal of the game is to navigate the ship towards your final destination, which would be easy if only players weren\u0026rsquo;t divided into three different factions. Each secret faction wants to reach a different area of the board. Every turn the ship will sail in one of the three possible directions \u0026mdash;but which one will it be? The current captain and their chosen lieutenant will study ancient sea maps and pass their often conflicting orders onto the chosen navigator, who has to make the final decision. Meanwhile the rest of the crew is busy drinking rum, gambling and telling each other tales of ancient sea monsters.\n\nAfter each navigation, the lieutenant and navigator go off duty, and the captain has to find somebody sober enough to take their spot instead. Everyone can discuss, how well that last navigation went, who is to blame for the current course, and who should be in charge in the future instead. Convince your enemies that it is in their best interest to make you the next lieutenant, or navigator! You can even draw your guns and become the new captain in open mutiny! But for how long will you be able to keep the trust of your crew? The next mutiny might already be waiting for you if your decisions don\u0026rsquo;t please your fellow sailors.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from designer\n\n",

    "name": "Mysterium",
    "year": 2015,
    "description": "In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s\u0026eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.\n\nUnable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.\n\nIn Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.\n\nEach hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.\n\nAfter time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn\u0027t keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.\n\nIf one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.\n\nMediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards \u0026mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon \u0026mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.\n\nIf a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...\n\n",

    "description": "San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and \u0022violet\u0022 buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.\n\nIn each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.\n\nThough similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.\n\n",

    "description": "In Smartphone Inc., you become a CEO of one of the largest smartphone-producing companies in the time when smartphones were only beginning to conquer the world. Research technologies, develop your factory, build your worldwide office network, and outprice your competitors to become the most profitable and successful smartphone company in the world.\n\nSmartphone Inc. is an economic simulation Eurogame. Over five rounds, players program their decisions about price, production, research, and expansion. The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanisms with bidding and action selection. Each of the rounds consists of eight simple phases: planning, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, selling, and profits.\n\nIn the planning phase, all players simultaneously make decisions for the next year by overlaying (\u0022patching\u0022) their two plan cards and all of their development tiles. The actions they plan on their cards and tiles in this phase will determine what actions they can perform during all of the later phases.\n\nIn the pricing phase, players change the price they charge for their smartphones based on their plan. A lower price helps to go earlier and sell more smartphones on the market, but a higher price, while risky, helps players to earn more money.\n\nIn production, all players produce smartphones.\n\nIn development, players take development tiles, which expand their planning possibilities in future rounds.\n\nIn research, players discover new technologies. Each technology not only expands players\u0027 ability to sell smartphones to customers, but also gives them special powers they can use during the game.\n\nIn the expansion phase, players open offices in neighbor regions, which allow them to sell in that region and develop their network of offices to more regions in further turns.\n\nIn the sale phase, players sell the phones they produced in regions where they have offices. But there is limited space in each region - and if your price is too high, cheaper rivals can block you from selling.\n\nIn the profit phase, players get income for their sales. Players gain the sale prices for all of their sold smartphones, and the player who sold the most phones in each region gains a bonus for controlling the accessory market. At the end of this phase all sold smartphones are discarded from the map - and a new round begins.\n\nAfter five rounds, the richest player wins.\n\n",

So long plows and veggies!\n\nIn Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, you become an animal breeder of horses, cows, sheep and pigs and try to make the most of your pastures. Players start with a 3x2 game board that can be expanded during play to give more room for players to grow and animals to run free. Sixteen possible actions are available for players to take, with each player taking three actions total in each of the eight rounds.\n\nThe player who amasses the most victory points through enclosing space with fences and acquiring the largest number and variety of animals and victory point-generating buildings will be the winner.\n\nFour Standard Buildings and 4 special buildings are available in the base game.  These buildings each provide unique special abilities during play and/or VP at game end.  Balancing the tension between building infrastructure (fenced pastures and buildings) and acquiring animals (the single biggest source of end-game scoring) is the key to success!\n\n",

Chaos, Dwarf, Wood Elf, Human, Orc, and Skaven teams compete against each other over the course of a brutal season. Customize your team by drafting Star Players, hiring staff, upgrading facilities, and cheating like mad. Lead your gang of misfits and miscreants to glory over your rivals all to become Spike! Magazine\u0027s Manager of the Year!\n\nOnce a manager has chosen one of the six teams, he has five weeks to groom them into the best in the league, culminating with the Blood Bowl tournament. He does this by competing at highlights, collecting payouts, upgrading his personnel, and drafting Star Players.\n\nManagers begin the season with a starting team deck full of basic scrub players. These players are none too bright and have limited talents, but a clever manager can play to their strengths by carefully positioning them to excel on the pitch.\n\nIs your team ready to compete against other teams in head-to-head highlights? Highlights are the randomly determined matchups over which players compete. The more highlights a team wins, the more it improves and the more fans it accumulates.\n\nThe season culminates with the Blood Bowl tournament. After the Blood Bowl, the season ends. Players then tally up their total fans and the manager with the most fans wins the game.\n\n",

Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.\n\nThe players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own \u0026ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile\u0027s special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.\n\nTo exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.\n\nTo win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.\n\nThere are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village\u0027s tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.\n\n",

Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!\n\nThe Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.\n\nPlayers are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players\u0026rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.\n\nRule Correction:\n\nFor first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: \u0022Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7\u002B players use all 15 Plot Cards.\u0022 and \u0022...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)\u0022 - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.\n\n",

At the end of the game, though, cash is all that matters, and whoever has the most money wins.\n\nThe game also features drive-by shootings in which enemy tokens are removed from the board and placed face-down in the river.\n\n",

As the witch strives to complete a ritual of renaturation, the hunter tries to discover her true identity among nine villagers. Each turn, the two players use their action pawns on active villagers to draw cards, play cards, and gain influence. Each player has their own variable card deck of fifty cards; with these cards, the witch can brew powerful potions, improve their familiar, and cast enchantments and charms, while the witch hunter enlists allies, claim strategic locations, and ruthlessly investigates the villagers.\n\nAs the witch, your objective is to collect enough secrets to perform a ritual so potent that the entire region will fall under your spell and Mother Nature will reclaim the island. As the hunter, you gather all the allies and support you can muster to bring the witch to justice before her fatal ritual comes to fruition.\n\nThe prototype won the Danish design award Otto at the Fastaval for best game of show in 2018.\n\n-description from publisher\n\n",

Players are builders who try to contribute the most to this cathedral\u0027s construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points.  Gameplay roughly consists of using workers to produce raw materials, and then using craftsmen to convert the materials into victory points.  Workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game.  Players are also given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or just obtaining victory points.  Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing better craftsmen.  Players must strike a balance between earning gold to fund their purchases and earning victory points.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n\n     The Pillars of the Earth Expansion Set (which include the Expansion Cards in some editions)\n     The Pillars of the Earth: Expansion Cards (which are included in the Expansion Set in some editions)\n\n\n",

Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.\n\nIn Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game\u0026rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it\u0026rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.\n\nManeuver Tool\nThe maneuver tool is one of the game\u0026rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.\n\nIt consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship\u0027s course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.\n\nCommand Stack\nArmada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy\u0026rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.\n\nCapital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they\u0026rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can\u0026rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.\n\nEach of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits.\n\n",

Many great scientists, with their theories and ideas, changed and shaped our perception of the universe: Galileo Galilei, Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon and, above all, Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nIn Newton, the players take the role of a young scientist who wants to become one of the great geniuses of this era. To reach their ultimate goal, they travel around Europe, visit universities and cities, study to discover new theories, build new tools and work to earn money.\n\nThe game is played over six rounds. Each round, every player plays five cards from their hand, and each played card allows the player to perform one of the many actions of the game. An action can have a variety of effects, which depend on the symbols on the board. At the end of the round, a player can take back all the cards except for one. One card has to remain on the board, which means that you give up one possibility of doing that action, but also that that very action will be carried out with greater strength. Fortunately, you can acquire new cards with additional powers to perform more actions.\n\nAfter six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins.\n\n\nThe New Edition includes:\n- Newton: Great Discoveries Expansion\n- Newton: Robert Hooke Promo Card\n- Newton: Stephen Hawking Promo Card\nAny other promos are not included.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\nUPC 889696009043\n\n",

In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3\u0026ndash;5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end is the winner.\n\n\nPlayers play as well-off Parisians in the 14th century who wish to improve the importance and appearance of the city quarter around the famous Notre Dame cathedral. The primary game concept is original, but simple, card play players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter. However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications. If one does one thing, then the other can\u0027t be done. Concentrating on one aspect means automatically ignoring another, which, above all others, is particularly dangerous in the case of the gradually approaching plague...\n\nAfter 9 exciting rounds and about 75 action-filled minutes, Notre Dame is over. The maitre who has made the most of his cards and has garnered the most prestige points is the winner.\n\nDescription from Alea.\n\nThis game is #11 in the Alea big box series.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     6-/7-player expansion (unofficial)\n     Treasure Chest\n\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n     Notre Dame Express (unofficial)\n\n\n",

    "year": 2018,
    "description": "At the height of its power, the Roman Empire held more than two million square miles of territory containing over a hundred million people. Throughout the centuries of its existence, the Empire brought major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature. By the beginning of the 5th Century, decades of political corruption, economic crisis, and an overburdened military had exacted a severe toll on the stability of the Empire. This paved the way for severe incursions from aggressive barbarian tribes, leading to a decline from which Rome would not recover. Now citizens, soldiers, and allies of Rome must unite to protect the Empire.\n\nCombining the cooperative gameplay of Pandemic with innovative new mechanisms, Pandemic: Fall of Rome takes players back in history to the time of the world\u0027s greatest empire: Rome. A weakened military has left the borders open to invasion from countless tribes such as the Anglo-Saxons, Goths, Vandals, and Huns. As you march through the Roman Empire, you must recruit armies, fortify cities, forge alliances, and face off against the invading hordes in battle.\n\nSimply defending Rome is not enough; players must find a way to stop the incursions and find peace with their neighboring peoples. Players collect sets of matching-colored cards to forge an alliance with the different tribes. In doing so, they gain the ability to use cards matching the tribe to convert other members of that tribe into Roman soldiers, furthering their ability to hold the line against other invaders.\n\nTake on unique roles with special abilities to improve your team\u0027s chances to protect against the invaders. Work together, use your skills wisely, and stop the fall of Rome!\n\nPandemic: Fall of Rome includes a solitaire mode in which the player takes on the burden of being the Emperor and commands three different roles to try to protect the city from the invading hordes. Players who want a more difficult game can try the \u0022Roma Caput Mundi\u0022 challenge by adding more Revolt cards to the deck; they must also respect the law in Rome that Roman legions are not allowed in the city.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "name": "Chess",
    "year": 1475,
    "description": "Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side of the board. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent\u0027s pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes that defeat is inevitable and ends the game), or one of several types of draws.\n\nChess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. The 2020 Netflix series, The Queen\u0027s Gambit was enjoyed by both chess players and non-players alike. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. Chess is so well known and highly regarded that it is often used as a metaphor in journalism, poetry, fiction, and film.\n\nChess evolved from the ancient Indian game Chaturanga, which became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n",

    "description": "Altiplano is a bag-building game along the lines of Orl\u0026eacute;ans, set in the South American highlands of the Andes (the \u0022Altiplano\u0022). The competition for limited resources is considerable, as it was in Orl\u0026eacute;ans, but the greater focus in Altiplano is on building up your own production to be the best that it can be - or at least better than that of the other players!\n\nThe object of the game is for players to use their goods to produce more goods that will be worth points in the end. Each player starts with a unique role tile, giving them access to different goods and methods of production. Players have limited access to production at the start, but they can acquire additional production sites during the game that open up new options. The various types of goods \u0026mdash; such as fish, alpaca, cacao, silver and corn \u0026mdash; all have their own characteristics and places where they can be used. For example, silver can be sold for a high price at the market, fish can be exchanged for other goods at the harbor and alpaca can produce wool at the farm that can then be made into cloth.\n\nAside from building up an effective production, players must fulfill their orders at the right time, develop the road in good time and store their goods cleverly enough to fill their warehouses in the most valuable way. Often, a good warehouse keeper is more relevant in the end than the best producer.\n\n",

Spring has arrived and it\u0027s time to build the hive, find nectar, make honey, and, for the first time ever, set up shop.\n\nHoney Buzz is a worker bee placement game where players expand a personal beehive by drafting various honeycomb tiles that grant actions that are triggered throughout the game. Each tile represents a different action. Whenever a tile is laid so that it completes a certain pattern, a ring of actions is triggered in whatever order the player chooses. A tile drafted on turn one could be triggered up to three times at any point during the game. It all depends on how the player places their beeples (bee\u002Bmeeple) and builds their hive. After all, in the honey business, efficiency is queen.\n\nAs you continually expand your hive, you\u0027ll forage for nectar and pollen, make honey, sell different varieties at the bear market, host honey tastings, and attend to the queen and her court. There\u0027s only so much nectar to go around, and finding it won\u0027t be easy. Players will have to scout out the nectar field and pay attention to other players searches to try to deduce the location of the nectar they need for themselves.\n\n",

With a huge shopping culture, Edo\u0027s main district, Nihonbashi, was lined with shops, selling kimonos, rice, and so much more.\n\nNihonbashi is the focus of IKI: A Game of EDO Artisans, which brings you on a journey through the famed street of old Tokyo. Hear the voices of Nihonbashi Bridge\u0027s great fish market. Meet the professionals, who carry out 700\u0026shy;-800 different jobs. Enter the interactivity of the shoppers and vendors. Become one with the townspeople.\n\nOne of the main professions in the world of Edo is the artisan. Each of the Edo artisans uses their own skill of trade to support the townspeople\u0027s lives. In this game, not only are there artisans, but street vendors, sellers at the shops, and professions unique to this time and age. Meet the puppet masters, putting on a show. Meet the ear cleaners that people would line up for.\n\nThe goal of this game is to become the annual Edoite, best personifying what is known as \u0022IKI\u0022, an ancient philosophy believed to be the ideal way of living among people in Edo. Knowing the subtleties of human nature, being refined and attractive \u0026mdash; these are all elements of a true IKI master.\n\n",

You can use the abilities of some helpers to increase your income or production.\n\nFields, customers, helpers, and miscellaneous objects are represented by cards. Each player receives two of these cards per round distributed by a bidding/drawing mechanism in which you end up with one of the cards you draw and one of the cards of a public offer filled by all players. Additionally, to these cards you always receive one field for free each round.\n\nPlacing one good on a field fills the complete field with goods of this type. Each round, one unit per field is harvested. After planting, harvesting, and distributing cards, each player can use as many actions as he wants, only limited by the number of his cards or the number of goods he owns. At the end of his turn, he can invest the earned money on a scoring track, where early money is worth more than late money. The game ends after a certain number of rounds, and the player who is first on the scoring track wins.\n\nOnline Play\n\n     Yucata (turn-based)\n\n\n",

The demon-tainted Uthuk Y\u0027llan barbarians stalk the realm and the undead servants of Waiqar the Undying venture beyond their borders for the first time in memory. The leaders of Terrinoth are divided and fractious, unable to unite against these common threats. And in the northern barony of Forthyn, the stage is set for the next great confrontation between Terrinoth and the forces of darkness. For years, your journeys have taken you across the fantasy realm of Terrinoth, venturing into dark forests, shadowy cities, ancient crypts, and misty swamps \u0026mdash; but your true legend is about to begin.\u0027\u0027\n\nForge your own legend together with friends as you adventure across the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth in the co-operative dungeon-crawling board game Descent: Legends of the Dark. Powered by an integrated free companion app, Descent: Legends of the Dark puts you in the role of a budding hero with their own playstyle and abilities. Together with your unlikely companions, you\u0027ll begin an unexpected adventure \u0026mdash; an adventure told across the sixteen quests of the \u0022Blood and Flame\u0022 campaign. Throughout your campaign, you\u0027ll face undead lurking in the mists, demonic barbarians stalking the wilds, and even more terrifying threats. With 46 pieces of 3D terrain and forty hero and monster miniatures to draw you into the game. Your objectives will change from quest to quest as you follow the overarching story of the campaign.\n\nCore gameplay mechanisms such as combat, fatigue, skills, items, and more have received completely new interpretations with Legends of the Dark, while a new approach to scenario layout and 3D terrain creates striking multi-level scenarios. You take three actions each turn: one maneuver action and two additional actions of your choice. Every hero also has an attack card and skill cards! Each hero starts the game with two weapon cards, which are sleeved together back-to-back to create a single attack card.  Skill cards can also be readied, switching between two complementary abilities.\n\nThe app also brings new changes to gameplay, introducing enemies with adaptable strategies, complex status effects, and triggers fully managed by the app, and the ability to develop your heroes based on the choices you make in scenarios. You\u0027ll also uncover a wealth of activity between scenarios, such as crafting, shopping in the city, upgrading equipment, and more. Because of these various differences, Descent: Legends of the Dark is not compatible with Descent: Journeys in the Dark and its expansions.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "China, 1570. China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. He inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. He resided in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. Around this period, China was under heavy attack from the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of the Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.\n\nThe country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. Even though the penalties for corruption were very high, the highest Officials of the Forbidden City would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, by accepting gifts of petitioners, and returning one of seemingly lower value.\n\nG\u0026ugrave;g\u014Dng uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. Players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by exchanging gifts with Officials. The gift cards you offer as a player have to be of a higher value than the one you receive, forcing you to make strategic choices regarding which actions you want to take each turn. You will travel around China, sail down the Grand Canal, purchase precious jade, help construct the Great Wall, secure advantages through decrees, influence the game through intrigue, and ultimately, receive an audience with the emperor. If only 1 player succeeds in doing so, he wins. If several players succeed, the player with the most VPs among those players wins the game.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (bringing victory points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can provide the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over. The competition isn\u0027t sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.\n\nSaint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.  It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.  In each round \u0026ndash; with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability \u0026ndash; players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits. During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want. During later rounds, they have plenty of money, but the cards they\u0027d like to buy may have already come and gone...\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Sankt Petersburg: Das Bankett\n    Saint Petersburg: New Society \u0026 Banquet Expansion (includes The Banquet)\n\n\n",

It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.\n\nPlayers use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.\n\n",

Over eight rounds, you must visit eight animal fiefs and engage their rulers in dialogue (tricks). Each ruler\u0027s suit represents the trump for that fief. Each ruler also requires you to win an exact number of tricks to join your alliance, so the game gets harder as your options dwindle.\n\nYou start with four allies, each with an ability that you can use once per visit. These abilities can make you draw, discard, or otherwise manipulate your hand to help you hit the target score. Once you\u0027ve won a ruler over, you can pull them in to substitute temporarily for one of your allies, if you need a more specific set of abilities to tackle the harder fiefs.\n\nWith multiple difficulty levels, 24 rulers (12 used per game), and a 16-scenario challenge booklet, For Northwood! offers hours of gameplay with a new puzzle every time!\n\nWinner of *Best Overall Game* and *Jury Prize* in the 2021 BGG 54-card contest.\nAlso winner of *Best Art*, *Best Solo Game*, and *Best New Designer*!\n\n-description from designer\n\n",

Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It\u0027s a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.\n\n\n\n        Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.\n\n\n\n        Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror.  Will they Prevail? \n\n\nArkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft\u0027s Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it\u0027s up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It\u0027s up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close gates to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many gates open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world - defeat the Ancient One in combat!\n\n",

    "description": "Lost amidst the surreal and bizarre unknowns of the far reaches of the cosmos, your crew of explorers must pull together to discover the resources necessary to survive the long journey home.\n\nUnsettled is a 2-4 player cooperative survival adventure set in the wondrous and unnerving fringes of uncharted space. There are no enemies and no combat, only an environment where every step, every breath, every particle around you could mean immediate, terrifying, death. Enemies are the least of your concerns.\n\nIn these incredible conditions you must complete a series of tasks necessary to your continued survival. Perhaps the water reclamation system on the ship needs repair, or (as usual) food supplies are running low. Before you lies a strange alien landscape - it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to complete these tasks using\u0026hellip;whatever you find out there.\n\nEach time you play you will have a different combination of survival tasks to complete and the things you discover (and their weird properties) will be different as well. So while you always start out knowing what problems you need to solve you have no idea how you\u0026rsquo;re going to use the world before you to do so (or what the world is going to do to you while you try).\n\nAs you explore the environment, encountering wild \u0026 unique opportunities along the way, you will work closely with the rest of your crew to achieve your goal of continued existence. The only thing you can be sure of is each other; lose that trust and you\u0026rsquo;ll lose all hope of survival.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the designer\n\nThis core set comes with 2 planets, Planet 001-Wenora and Planet 002-Grakkis, which are not available individually.\n\nEmbrace your fungal hosts and discover mind-bending abilities beyond your imagination or be absorbed forever. Unsettled: Wenora is the 1st planet box for \u0022Unsettled\u0022.\n\nWenora is a bizarre and wondrous fungal jungle teeming with alien vegetation and gargantuan spore-based lifeforms.\n\nGrowth in this place is of a scale beyond any we\u0027ve encountered. Life drips and pulsates disturbingly, mysterious pastes and powders covering most of the planet\u0027s crawling surfaces. Simply traversing the land is deeply unnerving, yet awe inspiring all the same. Tentacles, toxic spores and an alarming array of suction cups abound.\n\nThings you may find here:\n\n     Electromagnetic Polypores\n     Incandescent Slime\n     Floating Tentacle Knots\n     Screaming Glow Frogs\n     Telekinetic Microbe Clouds\n\n\nDiscover pathways to the skies to escape violent storms and enormous creatures that haunt the surface. Unsettled: Grakkis is the 2nd planet box for \u0022Unsettled\u0022.\n\nGrakkis is a sand-swept desert ruins. What was once a massive planet-wide forest of unfathomably large trees is now that forest\u0027s graveyard - all the trees having long since petrified to a stone-like state. Some have crumbled into interesting formations. Some had rotted before petrifying, creating strange caves and crevices, many of them thousands of feet above ground. Colossal alien lifeforms, disturbing in their appearance, wander the wasteland. They tower horrifyingly in the distance like gods in some waking existential nightmare.\n\nThings you may find here:\n\n     Musical Stonewood Formation\n     Falling Stone-Fruit Bombs\n     Bioluminescent Paste\n     Blooming Geodes\n     Gaseous Sand Storms\n\n\n",

    "description": "Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.\n\nPlayers may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.\n\nBuying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.\n\nBus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player\u0027s end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players\u0027 routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.\n\n",

    "description": "In 1697 the Sun King, Louis XIV, emerged from a decade of war with his Continental ambitions still unsatisfied. Meanwhile, King William III of England sat easier on his new throne than he ever had before. With the Spanish succession crisis unresolved and looming, there were no illusions that the new century would be a quiet one. But neither France nor England could have anticipated the tumult of the years to come: a Second Hundred Years\u0027 War, during which these two tenacious adversaries would compete fiercely and proudly along every axis of human achievement. On battlefields from India to Canada to the Caribbean Sea their armies and fleets would clash; in the salons of Paris and the coffee-houses of London the modern world\u0026rsquo;s politics and economics would be born; and finally a revolution would rock the foundations of society \u0026ndash; a revolution that could have ended not in blood and terror but in a triumph of democracy and liberty that might have transformed the world beyond imagining.\n\nImperial Struggle is a two-player game depicting the 18th-century rivalry between France and Britain. It begins in 1697, as the two realms wait warily for the King of Spain to name an heir, and ends in 1789, when a new order brought down the Bastille. The game is not merely about war: both France and Britain must build the foundations of colonial wealth, deal with the other nations of Europe, and compete for glory across the span of human endeavor.\n\nImperial Struggle covers almost 100 years of history and four major wars. Yet it remains a low-complexity game, playable in a short evening. It aims to honor its spiritual ancestor, Twilight Struggle, by pushing further in the direction of simple rules and playable systems, while maintaining global scope and historical sweep in the scope of a single evening. In peace turns, players build their economic interests and alliances, and take advantage of historical events represented by Event cards. They must choose their investments wisely, but also with an eye to denying these opportunities to their opponent. In war turns, each theater can bring great rewards of conquest and prestige, but territorial gains can disappear at the treaty table. At the end of the century, will the British rule an empire on which the sun never sets? Or will France light the way for the world, as the superpower of the Sun King\u0027s dreams or the republic of Lafayette\u0027s?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?\n\nMage Wars \u0026mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy \u0026mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts \u0026ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!\n\nMage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called \u0022zones\u0022, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.\n\nEach player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells \u0026ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments \u0026ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.\n\nEvery Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:\n\n\n    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.\n    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he\u0027ll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.\n    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He\u0027s also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.\n    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She\u0027ll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.\n\n\nThe base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.\n\nNew Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!\n\nExtra copies of spells available with:\n\n    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1\n    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2\n\n\n",

    "description": "Edited description from Bruno Faidutti\u0027s write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:\n\nSkull \u0026 Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players\u0027 heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card \u0026ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that they can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid them, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with their own. If they show only roses, they win; if they reveal a skull, they lose, placing one of their cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull \u0026 Roses is not a game of luck; it\u0027s a game of poker face and meeting eyes.\n\nSkull \u0026 Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull \u0026 Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull \u0026 Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull \u0026 Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.\n\n",

    "description": "Set sail for an adventurous raid...for perhaps it will be your last! Face danger and adventure once more while you search high and low for the most valuable treasures the Caribbean has to offer, then quickly find a safe harbor to stash priceless gold, rare emeralds, and iridescent pearls. Explore, stockpile cargo, hire crew, and commandeer rival ships, but don\u0027t forget to bury your loot. As you sail, be on the lookout for a place to settle after your life on the high seas has come to an end, but before you do that, you must outpace your opponents as one trip around the Caribbean won\u0027t be enough. You must make three trips in order to retire as the richest and greatest buccaneer of all time.\n\nPirates of Maracaibo is a standalone game in the same franchise as 2019\u0027s Maracaibo, and players who are familiar with that game will recognize some beloved concepts from the original. However, new players can jump right in with no prior knowledge of the original game as Pirates of Maracaibo is an independent game with a more accessible rule set. The game plays over three rounds in which you sail the Caribbean, hire crew, ally with other ships, explore the shore, amass the most treasure, and (ideally) retire to a secluded island as the most revered pirate in history. Cast off sailors and swashbucklers, cast off!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the designer\n\n\nMicrobadge: \n\n",

Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you\u0027ve mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.\n\nBattle of Legends, Volume Two features four heroes: Yennenga, Achilles, Sun Wukong, and Bloody Mary.\n\nCombat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card\u0027s unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh\u0026auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.\n\nThe game includes a new battlefield with a brand new mechanism, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that\u0027s brought to life with the stunning artwork of Zoe van Dijk and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse. Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor.\n\nThe game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of \u0022person\u0022 cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers\u0027 abilities) to help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month\u0027s event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.\n\nCareful planning is the key to surviving \u0022the year of the dragon,\u0022 but survival alone may not win you the game.\n\n",

    "description": "High-stakes bidding on million-dollar race cars. Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.\n\nDownforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents\u0027 cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.\n\nThis is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play. Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more.\n\n",

    "description": "Ticket to Ride: M\u0026auml;rklin is the third installment in Days of Wonder\u0027s best-selling Ticket to Ride series.  The board for M\u0026auml;rklin is based on a map of Germany and each individual card in the deck depicts a different M\u0026auml;rklin Trains model.  A DVD introducing players to the M\u0026auml;rklin line of model trains is included [Edit: DVD no longer included in recent runs.]\n\nM\u0026auml;rklin is a heavier version in the TTR series, allowing players to not only travel from city to city but also from cities to countries. A new mechanic is also introduced in the form of passengers and merchandise tokens. When the game is set-up a series of merchandise values worth victory points are placed on nominated cities. The values of these tokens diminish when multiple tokens are present within a single city, requiring players to move quickly to capture the higher valued tokens.\n\nThese tokens can be collected by the players by placing their Passengers (3 per player), which can be achieved at the end of a turn in which a player lays trains to enter the city in question. Once a passenger is in play a player can forfeit their regular turn to move a passenger. Moving along a player\u0027s own train network comes at no cost and allows a player to take the top merchandise token from each city that is passed through. A passenger can also move along sections of track featuring other players trains but a passenger card must be paid each time this occurs to do so.\n\nThe player who completes the most destination tickets receives a 10 point bonus (instead of the base game\u0027s longest route bonus).\n\n",

    "description": "In Spartacus: A Game of Blood \u0026 Treachery, an exciting game of twisted schemes and bloody combats inspired by the hit STARZ Original series, each player takes on the role of Dominus, head of a rising house in the ancient Roman city of Capua. Each house is competing for Influence to gain the favor of Rome. Through a combination of political schemes and glorious battles on the arena sands your house will rise in fame and stature. As Dominus, you have a variety of resources at your disposal. Guards protect you from schemes launched by rivals. Slaves run your household and earn gold. Gladiators compete to bring glory to themselves and influence to their Dominus.\n\nThree main phases occur in each game round of Spartacus: A Game of Blood \u0026 Treachery.\n\nThe Intrigue Phase is when players launch their Schemes, hoping to raise their fortunes while undermining their rivals.  Schemes and Reactions are represented by cards in the Intrigue Deck. Players wield their Influence to put their Schemes into play, often asking for (or bribing) another player\u0026rsquo;s help in hatching the most complex plots.\n\nThe Market Phase is when players buy, sell and trade Assets (Gladiators, Slaves, Equipment and Guards). Players also bid against each other to acquire new Assets at Auction. Wealth is not the only path to success as players bluff and bargain with each other to acquire the Assets they covet.\n\nThe Arena Phase is when the bloody games are held. Gladiators from two rival Houses are pitted against each other in a brutal fight for glory. The spectacles of the games are represented by miniature combat on the arena board. Fighters pit their Attack, Defense and Speed dice against one another to determine the victor. All players seek to increase their fortunes by betting on the outcome of the gruesome conflict. Fighters who emerge from the arena victorious gain Favor and their Dominus gain Influence.\n\nThe goal of the game is to become the most influential house in Capua, securing your family\u0026rsquo;s power for years to come.  During the game, players will bribe, poison, betray, steal, blackmail, and undermine each other. Gold will change hands again and again to buy support, stay someone\u0026rsquo;s hand or influence their decisions. Will you be the honorable player whose word is their bond or the treacherous schemer whose alliances change with the wind?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Using quirky yet powerful Artifact cards, players must complete missions, destroy clones, and manage time-rending vortexes before it\u0027s too late.\n\nEach game unfolds across 7 Eras of Spacetime, with players activating special powers, chaining combos through the signature LOOP mechanic, and using energy to perform additional actions. Dr. Faux\u0026rsquo;s randomized movements and his cube-dropping 3D Machine introduce constant unpredictability and mounting tension, requiring teamwork and smart tactical choices.\n\nPlayers can choose from several game modes, including:\n\n     S.A.B.O.T.A.G.E. \u0026ndash; The base mission structure\n     Sayan Supa Clones \u0026ndash; Introduces beefed-up clones and persistent energy cubes\n     L.A.S.E.R. Centrifuges \u0026ndash; Limits action types by dimension, requiring precision\n     Ultramachina \u0026ndash; A multi-phase escalation mode with evolving threats\n\n\nVictory comes by completing missions (and sometimes additional tasks, depending on the mode). Defeat is always looming, whether through too many vortexes, failed missions, or running out of time.\n\nWith its retro sci-fi aesthetic, satirical humor, and satisfying puzzle-like gameplay, The LOOP offers high replayability, inventive combo play, and a delightfully chaotic journey through time.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n     Pandemic \u0026ndash; A cooperative game of global crisis management, where players must coordinate to prevent outbreaks. Like The LOOP, it features escalating threats, role powers, and shared objectives.\n     Quacks \u0026ndash; Shares the combo-building and chaotic \u0022bag-draw\u0022 mechanic spirit. The LOOP\u0026rsquo;s clone bag evokes similar tension and excitement.\n     Anachrony \u0026ndash; Another time travel game with a more complex, worker-placement framework. The LOOP offers a lighter, faster-paced take on timeline disruption.\n     Quirky Circuits \u0026ndash; A similarly zany and cooperative game where players must anticipate each other\u0027s plans while navigating chaos.\n\n\n",

    "description": "It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in. Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!\nYou represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your\ninfluence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.\n\nThe goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!\n\nEach round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player\u0027s Politics track. A player\u0027s influence in a region determines which cards they can draw. Once all players have passed, a new round begins.\n\n",

Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, in some editions, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\n\n\n     The 1986 edition (Hans im Gl\u0026uuml;ck) featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players\n     The 1997 edition (Moskito Spiele) supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well\n     The 2006 edition (Valley Games) also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer\n     The 2019 edition (Indie Game Studios/Spielworxx Kickstarter) simplified the game and adds a four-round option\n\n\n",

    "description": "THE GAME CONCEPT\nYou are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.\n\nOUTLINE OF GAME PLAY\nThe object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.\n\nGAME CHARACTERISTICS\nThe game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.\n\n",

    "description": "The Great Wall is a new asymmetric worker/soldier placement game with engine building themes and a twist in form of a constantly attacking AI (Mongolian Horde) that requires players to sometimes cooperate in order to defeat it. This is a new major board game from Awaken Realms.\n\nPlayers will control ancient clans in China trying to defend against invading Mongolian hordes and build a Great Wall. While every player will want to win (by earning VP = Honor) they also need to sometimes cooperate to defend against the hordes. Each clan will be asymmetric through its chosen Leader (resource production/starting resources/starting workers and units) and this asymmetry will increase as the game progresses (players will hire Advisors with unique skills, often creating unique engines).\n\nIn The Great Wall, the players take the role of Generals defending the Wall against the Mongol Horde. The game is played over a series of turns called Years, each divided into 4 parts called Seasons.\n\nDuring Spring, new barbaric hordes invade the fields in front of the Great Wall and prepare to launch their assault. Summer is the time when generals prepare for the assault and mobilize their forces. During Fall, players take their turns, playing Command cards, resolving their effects and Activating Locations to gain various benefits. In Winter, the last layer of Defense is activated, then, the hordes try to assault the Walls.\n\nDuring the course of the game, players will create their own unique engines based on their clan strength as well as interact with other players during all phases of the game, trying to get the most Honor points, which can be gained in a lot of different ways.\n\nAt the end of the game, the player with the most Honor wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and \u0022violet\u0022 buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.\n\nIn each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.\n\nThough similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.\n\nThis second edition of San Juan includes all the cards of the original game as well as the additional building cards from the alea Treasure Chest but not the event cards from that expansion. This edition also contains a new building card not previously available: \u0022The Hut,\u0022 a building that grants a card when nothing is sold in the trader phase.\n\n",

Any of his people may go up to Jerusalem in Judah to build the temple of the Lord, the God of Israel. And in any place where survivors may now be living, the people of Persia are to provide them with silver, gold, goods, livestock, and offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem. - Ezra 1:2-4 (paraphrased).\n\nDecades later, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes reign, the king noticed a sadness in his cupbearer, Nehemiah. When asked why he looked so ill, Nehemiah replied:\n\nMay the king live forever! Why should I not look sad when the city of my ancestors lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire? If it pleases you, and if I have found favor in your sight, let me go to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I may rebuild it. - Nehemiah 2:3-5 (paraphrased).\n\nThe aim of Ezra and Nehemiah is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game\u0027s end. Points are gained primarily by building the temple, rebuilding the city walls and gates, and by teaching the Torah to the returning exiles. Players may also seek to develop their land, travel to settlements outside the city walls, or stoke the altar\u0027s fire to keep it burning day and night. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah will be doing their part to keep the people focused on what is most important.\n\nOver three weeks (rounds), players will use their hand of cards, workers, and resources to do their part in rebuilding the great city of Jerusalem. After six days of work comes a Sabbath day of rest when food will be needed, and the week\u0027s work will be reflected upon. The game ends after the third Sabbath has been completed.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the designer\n\n",

    "description": "Bruxelles 1893 is a worker placement game with elements of bidding and majority control. Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yields the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.\n\nThe action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money \u0026ndash; acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige \u0026ndash; while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they\u0027ve placed their workers next to on the action board.\n\nAfter five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they\u0027ve completed their work, and their money on hand. The player with the most points wins.\n\n",

The game draws heavily on Manga/Anime inspiration for its art, and parodies Magic: the Gathering, Yugioh, and many other collectible games.\n\nIn this game you will build decks, play the meta, acquire valuable collections, crack open random boosters, and compete in tournaments for prizes and fame. The game takes you from Starter Deck to Regionals in about 2-3 hours. The game features a system of card pods, where you will play with about 400 of the base game\u0026rsquo;s 600 cards every game.\n\nMultiple games can also be chained together to form a Campaign, going from Regionals to Nationals in game 2 and from Nationals to Worlds in game 3, with each game introducing ever more powerful cards and higher stakes, but also resetting the power of the game so that each player has a fair chance to win each \u0027season\u0027 of the campaign.\n\nAt its heart, it\u0026rsquo;s a commodity trading game, except that instead of cubes or stocks, the things you\u0026rsquo;ll be buying, selling, and speculating on are trading cards that can be used throughout the game in periodic tournaments. By trading wisely, playing the market, working together with friends, building collections, and winning tournaments, you\u0026rsquo;ll secure points and become the Millennium Blades World Champion.\n\n",

Players receive some cards in hand, which they are required to sort from low to high, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table.\n\nOn your turn, choose any single card to reveal, either the low or high card from a player\u0027s hand (including your own) or any face-down card from the table. Then, do this again. If the two cards show the same number, continue your turn; if they do not, return the cards to where they came from and end your turn.\n\nIf you reveal three cards showing the same number, take these cards as a set in front of you. If you are the first player to collect three sets, you win \u0026mdash; except that a player wins immediately if they collect the set of 7s or two sets that add or subtract to 7, e.g., 4s and 11s.\n\nNote that nana and Trio contain identical components, but nana is labeled for 2-5 players, while Trio is labeled for 3-6 players. Trio has slight changes to the rules, with players using all cards no matter the player count. Additionally, you play in normal mode \u0026mdash; winning with three sets or the 7s \u0026mdash; or \u0022spicy\u0022 mode, winning with two linked sets or the 7s.

Each villain has a unique battlefield with unique objectives. If the villain completes their objective (or defeats the heroes), the players lose. The villains are aided by a number of possible minions: Jersey Devil, Ant Queen, Loveland Frog, The Blob, Tarantula, and Skunk Ape. The enemies use special action cards and a simple targeting scheme to control their movement and attacks.\n\nThe set comes with four new heroes: Nikola Tesla discharges his electrified coils to power up his effects; Annie Christmas gets stronger when she\u0027s fighting from behind; The Golden Bat, the world\u0027s first superhero, has a variety of powerful effects; and Dr. Jill Trent, Science Sleuth, calls on a collection of gizmos.\n\nKeeping to the Unmatched brand, you may use heroes from other Unmatched sets in Unmatched Adventures, and you can use the included heroes and battlefields to play competitive Unmatched.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.\n\nAlthough battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.\n\n(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)\n\nThis game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.\n\nCivilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a \u0022technology tree,\u0022 allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.\n\n",

Teams take turns rotating a dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum. One of the players on your team \u0026mdash; the Psychic \u0026mdash; knows exactly where the bullseye is, and draws a card with a pair of binaries on it (such as: Job - Career, Rough - Smooth, Fantasy - Sci-Fi, Sad Song - Happy Song, etc). The Psychic must then provide a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries.\n\nFor example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the \u0022cold\u0022 side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region. Perhaps \u0022salad\u0022?\n\nAfter the Psychic gives their clue, their team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on that spectrum.

    "description": "Evolution: Climate is a standalone game that introduces climate into the Evolution game system.\n\nIn Evolution: Climate, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce, predators lurk, and the climate can swing between scorching hot and icy cold. Traits like a Hard Shell and Horns can protect your species from Carnivores while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach.  Heavy Fur and Migratory can protect your species from the cold while being Nocturnal or Burrowing will provide protection from the cruel desert sun. With over 200,000 ways to evolve your species, every game evolves into a different adventure.\n\nThe Climate standalone game dramatically changes game play with several simple additions to the Evolution base set:\n\n     Players draw 4 cards \u002B1 per species per round (instead of 3 cards \u002B 1 per species).\n     Each species may have up to 4 traits (instead of 3).\n     The climate moves along a Climate Track based upon the food cards played each round.\n     There are additional trait cards that provide protection from the heat and cold.\n\n\nEvolution: Climate changes Evolution from a two-dimensional game (dealing with the threat of Starvation and Carnivores) into a three-dimensional game (dealing with the threat of Starvation, Carnivores, and Climate effects) while increasing the vividness of the theme. It adds additional layers into what was already a dynamically strategic game.\n\n",

In this Golden Age of wisdom and knowledge, be mindful not to neglect one in pursuit of the other.\n\nThe aim of Scholars of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at the game\u0026rsquo;s end. Points are gained by translating scrolls, increasing knowledge in various areas of science and mathematics, influencing the 3 guilds, and by retiring translators after their years of faithful service. The game end is triggered once all 4 caliph cards have been revealed.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Santa Maria is a streamlined, medium complexity Eurogame in which each player establishes and develops a colony. The game features elements of dice drafting and strategic engine building. The game is low on luck and has no direct destructive player conflict; all components are language independent.\n\nIn the game, you expand your colony by placing polyominoes with buildings on your colony board. Dice (representing migrant workers) are used to activate buildings; each die activates a complete row or column of buildings in your colony. The buildings are activated in order (left to right / top to bottom), then the die is placed on the last activated building to block this space. It is therefore crucial where you put new buildings in your colony, and in which order you use the dice.\n\nAs the game progresses, you produce resources, form shipping routes, send out conquistadors, and improve your religious power to recruit monks. When you recruit a monk, you must decide if it becomes a scholar (providing a permanent special ability), a missionary (for an immediate bonus) or a bishop (for possible end game points). The player who has accumulated the most happiness after three rounds wins. The available specialists, end game bonuses and buildings vary from game to game, which makes for near endless replayability.\n\n",

Each case includes a number of cards that ask you to find something on the map or uncover where someone has gone or otherwise reveal information relevant to a case. The city map serves as a map in time as well as space, so you\u0027ll typically find people in multiple locations throughout the streets and buildings, and you need to piece together what happened, whether by going through the case card by card or by reading only the starting card in the case and trying to figure out everything that happened for yourself. Will you be able to answer all questions about the case without fail?\n\nUnlike the original MicroMacro: Crime City, Full House marks each case with symbols so that parents can decide which cases the youngest investigators are cleared to research.\n\n",

Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during their story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points during battles, the heroes\u0027 souls regenerate, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts.\n\nDesigned by Gremlin Project (the same team who created Galaxy Defenders),  the game system in Sword \u0026 Sorcery represents the perfect evolution of its forerunner. Gameplay is faster and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, with new features never seen before in a game of this category.\n\nKey features of Galaxy Defenders are also preserved in Sword \u0026 Sorcery, such as the advanced AI system for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and the multiple tactical options during battles. Sword \u0026 Sorcery packs, in a top-quality board game format, all the excitement of the best MMORPGs and action RPGs, to provide the ultimate heroic fantasy board game adventure.\n\nThis base game contains ACT I of II.\n\n",

    "year": 2016,
    "description": "As Hitler\u0027s grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler\u0027s ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators \u0022Schwarze Kapelle\u0022, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?\n\nBlack Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).\n\nBut every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.\n\nOn a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions \u0026mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling \u0022Conspire\u0022 action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.\n\nAfter the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.\n\nTo win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator \u0026 fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of \u0022Target\u0022 symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler\u0027s military support, but a Conspirator\u0027s security level decides if any \u0022Eagles\u0022 rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.\n\nPlayers will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.\n\n",

The earlier you wake up, the earlier you will be in turn order, and the better options you will be guaranteed to have. Wake up early too often, however, and your apprentices will become unhappy and stop working as efficiently. They would much rather sleep in!\n\nThen, players decide their actions for the turn, deploying their apprentice work force to various tasks. You\u0027ll need to buy paint, mix paint, work on painting the fresco, raise money (which you\u0027ll need to buy the aforementioned paint!) by painting portraits, and perhaps even send your apprentices to the opera in order to increase their happiness. Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you\u0027ll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and fresco segments you would like to paint.\n\nFresco includes several expansion modules, so you can play without expansions for a lighter family game or add in expansions to vary play and increase the decision-making and difficulty, resulting in a very flexible game with a high replay value.\n\n",

    "description": "Hera, tired of Zeus\u0027 infidelity, decides to take her revenge and releases the Titans on Mount Olympus. In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth. In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.\n\nAs they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image.\n\nThe world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx. Would that have been the extent of the underworld\u0027s involvement however...\n\nHades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld. The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface.\n\nAs a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power.\n\nIn Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game. Choose your God, draft your warband and take the fight to your enemies with the might of the most powerful beings from Greek mythology at your back.\n\n",

    "description": "Here I Stand: Wars of the Reformation 1517-1555 is the first game in over 25 years to cover the political and religious conflicts of early 16th Century Europe. Few realize that the greatest feats of Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ignatius of Loyola, Henry VIII, Charles V, Francis I, Suleiman the Magnificent, Ferdinand Magellan, Hern\u0026aacute;n Cort\u0026eacute;s, and Nicolaus Copernicus all fall within this narrow 40-year period of history. This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.\n\nThere are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory:\n\n    The Ottomans\n    The Habsburgs\n    The English\n    The French\n    The Papacy\n    The Protestants\n\n\nHere I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccol\u0026ograve; Machiavelli published his masterpiece \u0022The Prince,\u0022 backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.\n\nHere I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics, and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3\u0026ndash;4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.\n\n",

The team has only seconds to assess the situation and devise a plan of attack \u0026ndash; then you spring into action like the trained professionals that you are. You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse, and lives are in danger.\n\nYou must succeed. You are the brave men and women of fire rescue; people are depending on you. This is what you do every day.\n\nFlash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game of fire rescue.\n\nThere are two versions of game play in Flash Point, a basic game and expert game.\nIn both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire.\nAs the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building.  Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles.  If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.  Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.\n\nThe expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.  The game includes a double sided board with two different building plans and several expansion maps are available.\n\n",

The last team of planners couldn\u0027t cut it, so the city turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this tiny town into a thriving civic center it\u0027s you.\n\nIn Sprawlopolis, players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. Each turn, players will play 1 card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types. Watch out though, the city hates paying for road maintenance so each road will cost you points in the end. When all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met dynamically generated minimum score for their game.\n\nCan you meet the demands of the officials, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate urban wonder?  It\u0026rsquo;s time to find out!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories.\n\nThe game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns.  In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops.  Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army.  Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.\n\nThe resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King\u0027s Council.  Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.\n\nEach adviser on the King\u0027s Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn.\n\nAt the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner.\n\nMany alternate strategies are possible to win: will you go for the military way, disregarding economic and prestige buildings, or will you aim to complete the big Cathedral to please the King?   Will you use the Merchant\u0027s Guild to gain more influence in the Council, or will you go for balanced development?\n\n",

The Empire sends emissaries to foreign nations, brings technicians and scholars from the west, builds a network of railroads, and achieves an outstandingly fast industrial revolution.\n\nThe nation and Emperor count on the support of the Great Four, the big conglomerates that emerge with great power and massive control over the Japanese economy. They are called Zaibatsu, and their influence on the Meiji Emperor and importance on the fate of Japan is incredibly high.\n\nNippon is an Area Majority Game in which players control Zaibatsu and try to develop their web of power by investing in new industries, improving their technological knowledge, shipping goods to foreign countries or using them to satisfy local needs, and growing their influence and power as they oversee the era of rapid industrialization of Japan.\n\nThe foundations of the big Zaibatsu were the traditional silk workshops, but soon the conglomerates diversified their influence and power, building a complex structure of interconnected companies that made them giant players in the world\u0026rsquo;s new industrial era. Each player takes the reins of one of these big corporations and tries to develop it in order to grow and achieve power.\n\nTo win the game, players must carefully choose which types of industry to invest in to get the most influence over the Japanese islands. Every action that is taken helps to forge their own path to new opportunities.\n\nNippon is a fast-paced economic game with challenging decisions, set during an important time in Japanese history, and when a new great nation is born.\n\n",

The players take on the role of energetic and daring adventurers. Many exciting tasks and challenges await the players, whether they are a captain, governor, craftsman, or scholar. Those who chose the wisest course of action and have the best overall strategy will earn the most prestige at the end.\n\nMacao lasts twelve rounds, and in each round players select one new card from a display specific to that round, two of which were revealed at the start of the game and others that were revealed only at the start of the round. The deck of 96 cards includes all sorts of special abilities, with the more powerful actions costing more resources to put into play.\n\nOne player rolls six different-colored dice, then each player selects two of those dice (possibly the same ones chosen by opponents), then places cubes equal to the number and color of the two dice on a personalized \u0022ship\u0027s wheel.\u0022 For example, if a player chooses the blue die that shows a 5, he places five blue cubes on the ship\u0027s wheel position five spots away from the current round. (A player can never claim more cubes than the number of remaining rounds).\n\nPlayers rotate their ship\u0027s wheels each round, then use the cubes available to them in that round to perform various actions: activating cards selected in that round or earlier rounds, buying city quarters and collecting the goods located there, moving that player\u0027s ship around Europe to deliver those goods, acquiring gold coins, taking special actions with card previously activated, and advancing on a turn order track.\n\nPlayers score points by delivering goods, paying gold coins, using the powers on their cards, and building in Macao. Whoever has the most points at the end of twelve rounds wins.\n\nMacao is number 13 in the alea big box series, with an estimated difficulty on the alea scale of 6/10.\n\n",

The goal was to make a game inviting for non-gamers, but with a little subtlety under the hood for gamers.\n\nIn the game, you go on a three-day tour of human history, traveling thousands of years in a time machine to experience great moments from our past.\n\nThe game takes place over three rounds, each representing one day of your trip. Each day, you visit a series of historical events, spending a different number of hours at each.\n\nOn each turn, you choose to visit one historical event, and spend a certain number of hours doing it. Doing so will yield benefits, like checking off items on your itinerary for points, and earning Time Crystals so you can bend the space-time continuum on future turns.\n\nAlong the way, you\u0026rsquo;ll also score points for visiting historical events in chronological order.\n\nThe player with the most points after three rounds wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "year": 2015,
    "description": "Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience.\n\nIn Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.\n\nFirst, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock\u0026rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.\n\nSecond, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.\n\nBoth of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?\n\nIn the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?\n\n",

    "year": 1997,
    "description": "Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.\n\nThis entry lists a few different major card sets for Bohnanza: the base game for 3-5 players, the expanded game with the same name for 2-7 players (that is, first expansion included), and Bohnanza Pocket.\n\nIn the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can\u0027t rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you\u0027ve picked them up from the deck \u0026mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.\n\nOn a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the \u0022fields\u0022 in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that\u0027s not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn\u0027t good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete \u0026mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player \u0026mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.\n\nWhen you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the \u0022beanometer\u0022 for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.\n\nThe original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22\u0027s Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.\n\n",

    "description": "Each player attempts to score the most points by snaking caravan routes through the desert, trying to reach oases and blocking off sections of the desert. Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.\n\nPublisher\u0027s Description\nFrom the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.\n In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.\n Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe\u0027s caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert\u0027s oases? Don\u0027t forget to keep an eye on your opponents\u0027 caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.\n\nThrough the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.\n\n",

You take on the role of a Ranger, a protector of the mountain valley you call home: a vast wilderness transformed by monumental feats of science and technology devised to save the Earth from destruction long ago. The story of Earthborne Rangers is presented as a branching narrative campaign consisting of a main storyline and a multitude of side stories. In it, you can choose to follow the critical path or to strike off on your own to discover the Valley\u0027s many engaging characters, mysterious ruins, and beings both familiar and strange.\n\nYou begin by building a deck that reflects your Ranger\u0027s interests, personal history, and personality. Then, as you explore the open world and your story takes shape, you augment your deck with improved equipment, refined skills, and the memories of your journey.\n\nEach game session represents one day in the Valley, and you\u0027ll pick up in the same location on the map where you rested the night before. Your goal is to either complete one of your available missions or to explore the open world. The session ends when you\u0027re either forced to rest (through either fatigue or injury), or you choose to rest for the night.\n\nAn individual game session is played in rounds, and those rounds consist of turns. On your turn, you perform one action: either play a card from your hand, or choose an action from a card on the table. Each action allows you to interact thematically and narratively with the world, and each time you take an action, the world comes to life around you. Predators stalk their prey, rain pours from the sky, rocks tumble down the mountain to block your path, and much more.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Each turn, players have two options:\n\n    play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card\n    pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card\n\n\nHowever, the choices aren\u0027t so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.  The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.  Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.\n\nThe first versions of the game supported up to five players, but the German 2011 edition supports up to seven (simply by increasing the number of chips).\n\nThis game was originally published in Germany in 2004 by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.  Amigo\u0027s 2006 international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English. The game has subsequently been released in other countries under an assortment of names. The German 2024 edition includes additional cards to allow for play with variant rules.\n\n",

    "description": "From Christian Marcussen, the creator of Merchants and Marauders, comes Clash of Cultures, a civilization game in which each player leads a civilization from a single settlement to a mighty empire. Players must explore their surroundings, build large cities, research advances and conquer those who stand in the way. The game features a modular board for players to explore, 48 distinct advances, seven mighty wonders, and loads of miniatures and cards. The winner will create a culture that will be remembered and admired for millennia.\n\nAdvances\nThe game features about 48 distinct advances. The whole \u0022tech-tree\u0022 is very flexible with no dead ends, yet still intuitive, sensible and \u0022realistic.\u0022 Additionally you have a great overview of what advances other cultures have - no need to ask - just look.\n\nModular Board\nPlayers start with a civilization in its infancy. Move settlers to uncharted regions and reveal the terrain and its resources. Several mechanisms have been implemented to assure that an unlucky placement of region-tiles won\u0027t be a decider.\n\nPlaying Time\nThe game covers a time span similar to AH Civilization - that is to pre-gunpowder. This epic game is playable in about an hour per player! This is a pretty good playing time for a game that covers so much ground as this game will.\n\nCity management\nPlayers expand their cities through the game. But not just to the generic larger city. Players instead choose a building type which represents the growth of the city. For instance you can expand a city with a port, fort, temple and academy - all with different benefits! Additionally cities can be \u0022angry,\u0022 \u0022neutral\u0022 and \u0022happy.\u0022 Everything integrated in an intuitive and elegant fashion.\n\nMultiple paths to victory\nEarn points through:\n- Founding cities and increasing their sizes\n- Advances\n- Objectives \n- Wonders\n- Events\n\n",

Play as cunning field mice who must race through a castle now twenty times larger than before. The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra\u0027s minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Collin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith. Confound your foes as the wizened old mouse Maginos, or protect your companions as Tilda, the castle\u0027s former healer. Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra\u0027s weakness and defeat her.\n\nMice and Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle\u0027s housecat, Brodie. Mice and Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to hoard the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.\n\nMice and Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come \u0026ndash; assuming they can all squeak by...\n\n\n\nExpansion advice:\n\nFor those who have expansions for this game the recommended order by the game designer for playing them is as follows (see original post HERE):\n\n        Sorrow and Remembrance (Base game)\n        Cat\u0027s Cradle (Lost Chapter 1)\n        Heart of Glorm\n        The Ghost of Castle Andon (Lost Chapter 2)\n        Downwood Tales\n        Portents of Importance (Lost Chapter 3), connected to the story in Tail Feathers\n    \n\n\n",

    "description": "On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company\u0027s weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?\n\nIn Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:\n\n\n    Phase 1: Schemin\u0027 Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.\n    Phase 2: Stealin\u0027 The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player\u0027s best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!\n\n\nThe game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.\n\nEach player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they\u0027ll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \u0022steal\u0022 card when you\u0027re in a train car that holds one of these items \u0026mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you\u0027ll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he\u0027s collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.\n\nEach player\u0027s character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.\n\nYou can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you\u0027re running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent\u0027s deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he\u0027ll be happy to give you a bullet, too.\n\nAt the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!\n\n",

    "description": "The Mandala: the symbol of an ancient and sacred ritual. Colored sand is laid to create a symbolic map of the world before the pattern is ceremonially destroyed and the sand cast into the river.\n\nIn the two-player game Mandala, you are trying to score more than your opponent by collecting valuable cards \u0026mdash; but you won\u0027t know which cards are valuable until well into the game! Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields. As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their \u0022river\u0022 and \u0022cup\u0022. At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player\u0027s river. The player whose cup is worth more points wins.\n\nThe linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one \u0022field\u0022 for each player. The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.\n\nTo begin, each player receives a hand of six cards. Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala.\n\nOn your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields. All cards played into a mandala must follow the \u0022Rule of Color\u0022: Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area. Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can\u0027t play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain. If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards.\n\nA mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards. When this happens, the players \u0022destroy\u0022 the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color. Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first. The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup. The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on.\n\nOnce a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues.\n\nThe end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river. Both players then tally the value of all the cards in their cup, based on the position of the colors in their river, and whoever has the higher score wins!\n\nContents:\n\n     1 linen playmat\n     108 mandala cards (18 in each of 6 colours)\n     2 reference cards\n\n\n",

You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!\n\nIn Fantastic Factories, you race to manufacture the most goods or build the most prestigious buildings. There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting. Each round is split into two phases, the market phase and the work phase.\n\nDuring the market phase, you choose to either acquire a new blueprint for free or pay to hire a contractor. Blueprints are used to construct new factories during the work phase. Contractors can be used to reinforce your strategy by providing resources or allowing you to roll additional dice. You need to be mindful of what cards are available in the marketplace and the strategies your opponents may be pursuing.\n\nDuring the work phase, all players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to run factories. Factories start as blueprints and need to be constructed. Once constructed, each factory can be used once each turn. Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct sequence can enable a powerful chain of actions. Additionally, you can build training facilities that allow you to manipulate the dice values of your workers. Each work phase is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle in order to optimize your output of resources and goods.\n\nOnce any player has manufactured 12 goods or constructed 10 buildings, the game end is triggered and one additional and final round is played. The player with the most points wins (combination of building prestige and manufactured goods). With over 30 unique blueprints and countless synergies across buildings, each game is unique. Fantastic Factories offers a lot of replay value and satisfaction as players discover new factory engines with each game.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\nA large collection of solo puzzles have also been created for Fantastic Factories along with official tools to create more. This puzzle collection can be found in the BGG Play-By-Forum area.\n\n",

Also included are character boards, counters and markers, and dice.\n\nOne player controls a small group of determined humans, while the other plays an almost unending army of demonic creatures.  The game is thematic and highly asymmetric: human characters are stronger, but the demon characters are more numerous.  Gameplay is very straightforward with a minimum of rules, and each game plays in an hour or less.\n\nBasically, dice are allocated after rolling to perform actions, while cards or special abilities are also available.  The game is about managing decisions and choosing what to do with the resources that you have, managing difficult events and out-thinking your opponent.  Combat is handled by dice.\n\nComplexity is low, with the focus on theme and building towards a tense, climactic ending. \n Claustrophobia is played through scenarios of which there are several in the rulebook.  Generally speaking, the human characters are attempting to complete a task (e.g. escape the catacombs, close a portal) while the demons are focused on stopping them.  There are varying win conditions depending on the scenario chosen.\n\n",

You must lead the good citizens and emerging heroes of these communities to halt the Zeds\u0027 advances by (re)killing them, attempt to coordinate the discovery of a cure to this vile scourge, and preserve as much of the area and as many of its inhabitants as possible.

Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.\n\nPlayers each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players\u0027 military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.\n\nThe game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.\n\nNote that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill\u0027s General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.\n\n",

    "description": "From the back of the box:\n\nGlobal Power Struggle Begins\nWhich nation will take the lead and become world\u0027s dominant superpower?\n\nThe Manhattan Project makes you the leader of a great nation\u0027s atomic weapons program in a deadly race to build bigger and better bombs. You must assign your workers to multiple projects: building your bomb-making infrastructure, expending your military to protect it, or sending your spies to steal your rival\u0027s hard work!\n\nYou alone control your nation\u0027s destiny. You choose when to send out your workers\u0026ndash;and when to call them back. Careful management and superior strategy will determine the winner of this struggle. So take charge and secure your nation\u0027s future!\n\nAdditional description:\n\nThe Manhattan Project is a low-luck, mostly open information efficiency game in which players compete to build and operate the most effective atomic bomb program. Players do not \u0022nuke\u0022 each other, but conventional air strikes are allowed against facilities.\n\nThe game features worker placement with a twist: there are no rounds and no end-of-round administration. Players retrieve their workers when they choose to or are forced to (by running out).\n\nAn espionage action allows a player to activate and block an opponent\u0027s building, representing technology theft and sabotage.\n\n",

    "year": 2004,
    "description": "This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways. The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.\n\nThere are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.\n\nThe rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players \u003C 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.\n\nA battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.\n\nEach unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.\n\nCombat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit\u0027s card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit\u0027s card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).\n\nThe master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It\u0027s possible to bring a \u0022pre-fab\u0022 army to the battle in order to save time.\n\nThe basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.\nThe game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.\n\nHeroScape: Rise of the Valkyrie is the original master set for the HeroScape series of games.\n\n",

Each player takes the role of an ambitious aristocratic family. Who will be the best supporter of this young king, and the most powerful Lord of his time?\n\nIn Lancaster, the players want to proceed from simply being a Lord to being the most powerful ally of the king. They may achieve this by developing their own knighthood, as well as by clever deployment of individual knights in the counties of England, at their own castle, and to conflicts with France. In parliament, they try to push laws from which they will benefit themselves most. The player with the most power points at the end of the game is the winner.\n\nEvery turn, players send their knights to the different locations:\n\u0026bull; Counties, where they compete with knights from other players for rewards and the favor of the nobles.\n\u0026bull; The castle, to receive income or new knights.\n\u0026bull; Into conflict with France, where all players combine their power and try to gain power points.\n\nIn the counties, the strength of the knights is important, as you can remove the knight of another player by placing a knight of your own with higher strength in the same location.\n\n",

All-new dungeon tiles create new challenges and rewards as you explore deeper and deeper in the dungeon. Each quest brings new dungeons as well as new side adventures!\n\nThunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game. Each player starts with a basic deck of cards that they can use to purchase, or upgrade to, other, more powerful cards. Thunderstone Quest brings new play modes to the table. The game will tell a specific story with a series of pre-set dungeon tiles, monsters, heroes and support cards. Each will come with a series of mini-adventures and a story booklet that tells players what happens as they progress through the scenarios.\n\nOnce players have completed the quests they will be able to enjoy great replay value with the available selection of monsters, heroes, and support cards, as well as the new dungeon tiles, by choosing random set-ups before the start of play. Aside from heroes such as wizards, fighters, rogues, and clerics, cards will include supplies that heroes need like weapons, spells, items, or light to reach further into the dungeon.\n\nThe dungeon deck is created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different hero types, so players have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.\n\n",

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects their seventh building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.\n\nPlayers start the game with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.\n\nOn a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.\n\nThe 2016 edition of Citadels includes twenty-seven characters \u0026mdash; eight from the original Citadels, ten from the Dark City expansion, and nine new ones \u0026mdash; along with thirty unique building districts, and the rulebook includes six preset lists of characters and districts beyond the starter list, each crafted to encourage a different style and intensity of gameplay.\n\n",

    "description": "Black Rose Wars is a competitive fantasy game of deck-building, strategy, and combat set in the hectic universe of Nova Aetas in Italy. Each player is one of powerful mages of the Black Rose Order who aspires to become the new Supreme Magister in order to acquire the mighty power of the Black Rose Artifact and the Forgotten Magic. Mages must fight, fulfill Black Rose desires, and gain strength with their spells until their power reaches the containment threshold of the prison where they are exiled, finally freeing themselves. Each mage has at their disposal six schools of magic, each one with its own strategy to annihilate their opponents and increase their power.\n\nAt the start of the battle, mages start with a grimoire of six cards; as mages study more spells during play, their grimoire will increase. Every spell in Black Rose Wars has two different effects, increasing a player\u0027s adaptability during a fight.\n\nMages fight each other in a modular arena of hexagons called \u0022rooms\u0022. They summon powerful creatures, cast destructive spells, or devise dark deceptions with their enchantments. The game system is divided into different phases. Each turn, after choosing new spells from the six schools of magic, players plan their strategy in advance, placing cards face down. Later, they reveal the played cards to kill each other, solve missions, summon creatures, or destroy the prison rooms, one against each other and against the Black Rose (the playing system).  \nAfter being killed, mages are reborn immediately, allowing them to re-enter the fight without delay \u0026mdash; although their death still fed energy to those mages who caused it.\nThe mage with the most power at the end of the battle will be crowned Supreme Magister of the Order by the Black Rose itself.\n\n",

Players take territory tiles from a rondel. Picking a tile has not only influence on the actions you get by the surrounding tiles in your territory, it also determines when you\u0027ll have your next turn (and how many turns you will have in the game). But having a lot of turns is not always the best strategy for a successful chieftain.\n\nGlen More is 6 in the Alea medium box series, and is rated a 4 on the alea complexity level.\n\n",

To win the game, players need to lock each of the four entryways as apparently the custodian has abandoned the post and given up the school for lost.\n\nAs players get better, they can complete missions, track their development through a trophy-sticker system reminiscent of video games, and open envelopes that contain new material for the game, upping the challenge they face while also providing them with new powers and new heroes as well.\n\n",

Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that\u0027s as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player\u0027s 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).\n\nWhen a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can\u0027t place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round. After all players have placed all four architects, the round ends, all remaining tiles are removed, and the tiles for the next round laid out.\n\nAfter four rounds, the game ends. Players can move the inhabitants and energy among their tiles at any point during the game to see how to maximize their score. At game end, they then score for each of the six types of buildings depending on how well they build their city \u0026mdash; as long as they have activated the buildings with inhabitants or energy as required:\n\n\n    Residential buildings score depending on their height\n    Shops score depending on how many customers they have\n    Public services score depending on the number of districts in your city that have them\n    Parks score depending on the number of residential buildings next to them\n    Harbors score based on the longest row or column of activated harbors in the city\n    Factories score based on the number of adjacent shops and harbors\n\n\nSome buildings are worth victory points (VPs) on their own, and once players sum these values with what they\u0027ve scored for each type of building in their city, whoever has the highest score wins.\n\n",

    "description": "A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player, deck-building Strategic level board-wargame about the French and British conflict in North America.\n\nThe card-play contains a focus on a deck-building mechanic similar to Dominion, each card will have multiple uses like card-driven games. The players have to choose only one aspect of the card to use when it is played. Each space captured by a player will add another card to the capturing player\u0027s deck.\n\nFrom the box description:\n\nA war fought at the edge of two mighty empires. For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America. Thousands of miles from their homes, settlers and soldiers were faced with impenetrable forests, unpredictable American tribes, and formidable distances. Despite these obstacles they were able to engage in bitter warfare, with the British ultimately taking the prize of Quebec. A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player game that allows you to recreate this contest. You can change the course of history by your decisions.\n\nA Few Acres of Snow takes an innovative approach to the subject, using cards to represent locations and manpower. As the game progresses you add to your selection of cards, increasing the range of actions available to you. There are many strategies to be explored. How quickly should you build up your forces, do you employ Native Americans, what energy should be expended on your economy?\n\nThe game is about more than just fighting \u0026ndash; you must successfully colonize the land to have a chance.\n\nOnline Play\n\n     Yucata (turn-based)\n\n\n",

Amassed with an incredibly complex and inefficient system of refineries, the government has felt the severe pressures of worldwide demand and the ever-increasing global standards for refinement. Unable to keep up with demand, the government has only one option: privatizing the oil industry.\n\nThis is where you come in. Seeking to capitalize on this new opportunity, in Pipeline you start a company in the oil business. You will focus on building a much more efficient pipeline network in your refinery, hiring experts that provide valuable benefits over your competitors, and managing the logistics of purchasing and selling your refined oil in the various markets. You will need more than strong economic skills \u0026ndash; carefully crafting an interweaving network of pipelines just might ensure your victory!\n\n",

    "description": "In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.\n\nPlayers start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.\n\nOn a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.\n\nThe expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl\u0026uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square). With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players.\n\n",

You must help Robinson to survive the island and prepare him to defeat the pirates that are coming for the island.\n\nFriday is a solitaire deck-building game in which you optimize your deck of fight cards in order to defeat the hazards of the island. During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck. If defeated, a hazard card will become a fight card and is added to the player\u0027s deck. If failed, the player will lose life points but also get the opportunity to remove unwanted cards from their fight deck. In the end, the player will use their optimized fight deck to defeat the two pirate ships coming for the island, allowing Robinson Crusoe to escape the island and allowing you to finally have your peace back!\n\n",

Completed quests place white swords on the Round Table; failed quests add black swords and/or siege engines around Camelot. The knights are trying to build a majority of white swords on the Table before Camelot falls.\n\nOn each knight\u0027s turn, the knight takes a \u0022heroic action\u0022, such as moving to a new quest, building his hand, or playing cards to advance the forces of good. However, he must also choose one of three evil actions, each of which will bring Camelot closer to defeat.\n\nMoreover, one of the knights may be a traitor, pretending to be a loyal member of the party but secretly hindering his fellow knights in subtle ways, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...\n\nBut enough words... don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse, and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!\n\n",

Players assume the role of a party of adventurers in an ultra-modern fantasy setting that exists alongside our very own Earth.  During the game, players will experience an in depth, fully narrative-driven adventure that contains over 90 hours of content. Throughout the narrative you and three of your friends will confront real decisions that change the course of the story and its outcome.\n\nPlayers will face many dangerous adversaries throughout the story and will take part in heated combat with these foes. Middara features an innovative, dice based combat system for these encounters.  Based on their equipment and abilities, players will have access to unique two-dice combinations that will increase their attack and damage potential in a variety of ways.

With nine different types of dice, over 110 unique abilities and 150 unique pieces of equipment the possibilities for different character builds are endless.\n What makes Middara so compelling is that the outcomes of story decisions and encounters have far-reaching effects that determine how the story moves and resolves. Friends and family might get killed, or they may survive. Maybe the players avoid some problems entirely, only to be faced with a whole new challenge.\n\nGameplay Features:\n\n\n    Narrative-driven campaign that contains over 90 hours of content.\n    Unique dice-based success system featuring multiple dice that players can upgrade throughout the campaign. \n    36 modular map tiles representing different locations in the world, such as magical forests, caves, and swamps!\n    A.I. controlled monsters, NPCs, challenges, traps, and other narrative-driven obstacles.\n    Campaign character progression via a point buy system allowing players to ditch traditional classes and instead focus on building the character they want to play.\n    Over 110 unique Disciplines and over 150 unique pieces of equipment.\n    Stand alone scenarios for when you aren\u0027t playing with your campaign group, or even when you are!\n\n\n",

Shortly after the old city walls were finally destroyed, Ildefons Cerd\u0026agrave;, who is now considered the inventor of urbanism, presented the plan for the creation of the \u0022Eixample\u0022, the expansion that Barcelona so desperately needed. Its construction began in 1860.\n\nIn Barcelona, you will take on the role of builders in 19th-century Barcelona who are working on the new expansion to the city. Your main goal is to construct buildings to accommodate the citizens who want to leave the old city, and in the process, you will also build streets, create tram lines, and build public services. You may even decide to explore \u0022Modernisme\u0022, a new architectural and arts style that has been gaining popularity among the rich.\n\nBarcelona is played over a variable number of rounds interrupted by three scoring phases before a final scoring phase. Every round, each player takes a single turn consisting of two or more actions, a building phase, and then preparation for their next turn. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Paintings are scored based on a set of Scoring cards which will change each game.

Each of these cards has a cost associated with their position. After selecting an Art card you must pay its cost by placing an Inspiration token on each of the cards to its left. If you do not have enough Inspiration tokens, you may not select that card. Any tokens on the card you have selected are kept for future turns. The far left card costs no Inspiration tokens to take.\n\nIf you have three or more Art cards you may choose to make a painting.

    "description": "Aeon Trespass: Odyssey is a 1-4 player campaign game about adventures, exploration and fierce battles with giant monsters. It\u0026rsquo;s a co-operative, choice-driven boardgame experience played over multiple sessions. Set in an alternate Antiquity, where a reality-shattering cataclysm killed the Olympian gods and unleashed the otherworldly Primordials, Aeon Trespass: Odyssey places the players in the roles of Argonauts, the only people who can fight off the darkness and make things right.\n\nTake control of the Argo and its crew, train them and send them on adventures into the dangerous and mysterious lands of Ancient Greece (and beyond...). Learn the world\u0027s secrets and create new technologies that will give you an edge in combat - and outside of it. Manage your resources and develop your base of operations. Build new Facilities, craft new Weapons and equipment. Gather allies and forge political alliances with the world\u0026rsquo;s factions. And, most important of all, tame the Titans, arm them, evolve them and ride them to battle with the fearsome Primordials.\n\nYou win by defeating the main villains or solving a crisis, you lose if your Argonauts die, your crew abandons you, your ship gets destroyed, the villains fulfill their plot or time runs out. There are many ways to lose, but only a handful paths to victory.\n\nDuring Battles, 1 to 4 players must cooperate to defeat 1 giant Primordial boss-type monster controlled by a sophisticated AI system.  Outside of Battles, Aeon Trespass: Odyssey uses choice chain and choice matrix mechanics to track your decisions throughout the game. Those decisions matter and will have a drastic impact on all future play sessions, campaigns and playthroughs.\n\n",

    "description": "You and your opponents represent powerful developers in a burgeoning Nevada city. You will earn money and prestige by building the biggest and most profitable casinos on \u0022The Strip,\u0022 the town\u0027s backbone of dust and sin. You start with nothing but parking lots and dreams, but from there you build, sprawl, reorganize and gamble your way to victory. Score the most points investing in the most profitable development companies and putting the best bosses in control of the richest casinos. Put your dollars on the line . . . it\u0027s time to roll!\n\nThe game board is broken into 6 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty \u0027lots\u0027. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot\u0027s space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino\u0027s boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and points. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. Points go only to the casino\u0027s owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents\u0027 casinos to make more money. Ultimately, though, only points matter, and that means making yourself boss of the biggest casinos.\n\nLords of Vegas contains: \n\n    Snazzy game board \n    4 turn summaries \n    55 cards \n    40 chips in 4 colors \n    48 dice in 4 colors \n    4 poker chips \n    Lots of money \n    45 casino blocks \n    Rules \n\n\n",

(In Japanese, hanabi is written as \u82B1\u706B; these are the ideograms flower and fire, respectively.)\n\nThe card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1\u0026ndash;5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1\u0026ndash;5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they\u0027re visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.\n\nAn extra suit of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.\n\nHanabi was originally published as part of Hanabi \u0026 Ikebana.\n\n",

The players (leaders of a royal Egyptian family) choose their sites, build their pyramids, and thank Amun-Re and the other gods for their bounty.\n\nIn Amun-Re, each pharaoh wants to build the most pyramids. To accomplish this, they must first acquire a province where they can trade and farm. With their profits, they can buy new provinces and building-stones to erect pyramids. For all their actions players must make clever use of their power cards, and always offer appropriate sacrifices to Amun-Re.\n\n",

    "description": "Stuffed Fables is an unusual adventure game in which players take on the roles of brave stuffies seeking to save the child they love from a scheming, evil mastermind. Make daring melee attacks, leap across conveyor belts, or even steer a racing wagon down a peril-filled hill. The game delivers a thrilling narrative driven by player choices. Players explore a world of wonder and danger, unlocking curious discoveries. The chapters of Stuffed Fables explore the many milestones of a child\u0027s life, creating a memorable tale ideal for families, as well as groups of adults who haven\u0027t forgotten their childlike sense of wonder.\n\nStuffed Fables is the first \u0022AdventureBook Game\u0022, a new product line from Plaid Hat Games in which all of the action takes place in the unique storybook \u0026mdash; a book that acts as your rules reference, story guide, and game board, all in one! Each adventure in the game takes place over several pages of the immersive AdventureBook. The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page.\n\nOn their turn, a player draws five dice from the bag. The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player. White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle. Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color. Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks. Players can store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions, or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!\n\nPlayers can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing. In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges. And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises.\n\n",

The players explore the islands of South America, secure trading routes, and build settlements.\n\nThe actions available to players are determined through the use of a specialized cube tower, which has appeared in the Queen titles Im Zeichen des Kreuzes and Wallenstein. At the start of the game, this tower is seeded with action cubes, which come in seven colors, with each color matching a particular type of action. During the game players will drop additional action cubes into the tower \u0026ndash; but some of these cubes might get stuck in the floors of the tower while other cubes already in the tower are knocked free. Thus, players need to play both tactically \u0026ndash; taking advantage of the actions currently available in the best way possible \u0026ndash; and strategically \u0026ndash; using their knowledge of which actions do what to play well over the course of the game.\n\nThe game board is composed of nine, twelve or sixteen tiles, depending on the number of players. Players sail their ships through the landscape created for this game, landing on islands to plan and build settlements, which then supply resources and allow the player to earn victory points. Players might want to invest in cannons to protect themselves from pirates roaming the waters or acquire progress tokens to gain special advantages.\n\n",

Cards come in six colors: red for military, green for resource production, blue for trade, brown for scoring, purple for temples, and yellow for a variety of effects.\n\nWhen you construct a building, you build it in the appropriate location on the modular game board \u0026mdash; which is sized based on the number of players with the hexagonal tiles composed of seven landscape \u0022circles\u0022 \u0026mdash; then you place the card in your personal tableau in the appropriate stack of colored cards and activate the power of all of those cards already in your tableau, starting with the card at the bottom of the stack.\n\nWhen you make an offering, you discard cards, then receive the help of a god associated with one of the cards that you discarded, with the number of cards determining the strength of the associated action. You then refill your hand to five cards.\n\nThe game ends either when all the barbarian villages on the game board have been surrounded and attacked or when all the temples have been constructed. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\n",

    "description": "Prince John is coming to Nottingham! Players, in the role of merchants, see this as an opportunity to make quick profits by selling goods in the bustling city during the Prince\u0027s visit. However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!\n\nIn Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!\n\nDo you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant? Will you make a deal with the Sheriff to let you in? Or will you persuade the Sheriff to target another player while you quietly slip by the gate? Declare your goods, negotiate deals, and be on the lookout for the Sheriff of Nottingham!\n\nSheriff of Nottingham is the first game in the Dice Tower Essentials Line from Arcane Wonders.\n\n",

    "description": "Pandemic: The Cure, a dice-based version of the popular Pandemic board game, sets up in less than a minute and plays in 30 minutes. As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it\u0027s up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world\u0027s hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.\n\nPlayers roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities \u0026mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.\n\nAt the end of each turn, new \u0022infection dice\u0022 are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!\n\nPart of the Pandemic series.\n\n",

Betrayal Legacy consists of a prologue and a thirteen-chapter story that takes place over decades. Players represent families, with specific members of a family participating in one story, then perhaps an older version of those characters (assuming they lived) or their descendants showing up in later stories.\n\nWhy would people keep exploring a haunted mansion for decade after decade, especially when horrible things happen there? Curiosity, I suppose, or perhaps an ignorant boldness that comes from the belief that we know better than those who have come before. Look at all that we\u0027ve learned, marvel at the tools we have at hand! Surely we\u0027ll all exit safely this time...\n\nAs with other Betrayal titles, the game is narratively-driven, with elements that record the history of your specific games. The tools mentioned earlier, for example, become attached to specific families. This isn\u0027t just a bucket; it\u0027s my bucket, the one my grandpappy used to feed his family\u0027s pigs when he was a boy, and while you can certainly use that bucket, I know how to wield it best from the time he spent teaching me how to slop. Yes, it\u0027s an heirloom bucket, and when kept in the family, I get a bonus for using it.\n\n",

    "description": "In Thurn \u0026 Taxis, players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways. The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.\n\nPlayers build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may build only one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.\n\nPlayers start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card, and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn, a player will draw a card from a display of six, face-up city cards (or the top of the face-down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored, the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on their next turn.\n\nWhen a player exhausts their supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage, the end of the game is triggered. Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes their turn, and the game ends. Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, then lose points for unplaced post offices. The player with the most points wins.\n\nThe fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.\n\n",

Some spin dark conspiracies while others wait for hapless victims to devour or drive insane. It\u0026rsquo;s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within.\n\nDesigned by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the roles of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.\n\nDo you dare enter the Mansions of Madness?\n\n",

    "description": "Granada, 1278. At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.\n\nThe best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their \u0022native\u0022 currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.\n\nIn Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.\n\nThe money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player\u0027s turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player\u0027s Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.\n\nPlayers with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players\u0027 longest external \u0022wall\u0022 section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.\n\nIntegrates with:\n\n    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)\n\n\n",

    "description": "The year is 1913. The steamship SS Atlantica is two days out from port on its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to. However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship\u0027s chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse.\n\nLurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon. For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within. Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship.\n\nIf you\u0027re a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship\u0027s four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes. Everyone shares the same resource pool, but humans will try to preserve them while traitors will strive to subtly deplete them. Being able to tell when someone is purposefully draining the group\u0027s resources is harder than you think, especially when you take crises into account!\n\nAt the end of each player\u0027s turn, that player must draw a mythos card. Each of these cards represents a crisis that the whole group must try to resolve together. Some of these crises, such as \u0022Food Rationing\u0022, call for a choice that could potentially put the ship\u0027s passengers or resources at risk, while others, such as \u0022Hull Leak\u0022, call for a skill test in which failure could have disastrous consequences.\n\nDuring a skill test, each player contributes skill cards from their hand to a face-down pile shared by the group. Once everyone has contributed (or chosen not to), the cards are shuffled, then revealed. If enough of the correct skills were contributed, then the group passes the test! But if the wrong skills were contributed, they can actually hinder the results, leading to failure. Thus, skill tests are dangerous opportunities for traitors to sabotage the humans\u0027 efforts, so you have to stay on your toes at all times.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by \u0027spending\u0027 resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.\n\nSet-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\n\nA turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities\u0026mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.\n\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.\n\n",

In Shackleton Base: A Journey to the Moon, you will build structures on the base, while also funding projects from the corporations that provide special abilities and scoring opportunities.\n\nAt the start of the game, pick three corporations randomly from the seven available. Each corporation introduces new projects, actions, and scoring opportunities, along with their specific mechanisms. The game is played over three rounds, each divided into three phases:\n\n\u0026bull; Shuttle phase: Each player drafts a shuttle tile from an open display to determine which type of astronauts and resources they can use that round, as well as the turn order for the next phase.\n\n\u0026bull; Action phase: Players take turns deploying their astronauts on the moon to collect resources, build structures, or fund projects. Depending on which corporations were selected, different types of resources will be available, resources that can be used in various ways for the projects or to build structures. Each project provides ongoing abilities and scoring opportunities. Each corporation provides different ways to score points, which could be during the action phase, the maintenance phase, or at game\u0027s end.\n\n\u0026bull; Maintenance phase: Deployed astronauts are assigned to work on the structures (providing a bonus to the player owning them), then players collect income and pay maintenance costs. If corporations in play have end-round effects, those effects take place.\n\nThe end of the game brings a final scoring, then the player with the most points wins.\n\n",

    "description": "In Imhotep, the players become builders in Egypt who want to emulate the first and best-known architect there, namely Imhotep.\n\nOver six rounds, they move wooden stones by boat to create five seminal monuments, and on a turn, a player chooses one of four actions: Procure new stones, load stones on a boat, bring a boat to a monument, or play an action card. While this sounds easy, naturally the other players constantly thwart your building plans by carrying out plans of their own. Only those with the best timing \u0026mdash; and the stones to back up their plans \u0026mdash; will prove to be Egypt\u0027s best builder.\n\n",

    "description": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is dead. His last conscious action on his deathbed was composing the Lacrimosa movement of his Opus Requiem. You, as one of his sponsors, will meet with the widow in order to participate one last time in the funding of the works of the Austrian genius. Also, you will reminisce and retell all your memories alongside Mozart in order to make sure that she portrays you under the best light when writing her memoirs in order to enter history as Mozart\u0027s most important patron.\n\nIn Lacrimosa, players take the roles of patrons of the late musician, contributing with their fundings to the composer\u0027s works one last time. During the game, you play in two different timelines: the present and the past. In the present, you commission the missing parts of the Requiem from other composers in order to complete it. When developing past events, the game takes place in five epochs in which you contribute by buying new compositions from the composer to sell or exhibit, accompany him on the different journeys through the main courts and theaters in Europe, and gather the resources you need in order to support the musician during his career.\n\nDuring the game, you play cards from a limited hand that you will improve as the game progresses. These cards can be played either as actions or as resource generators, and players need to optimize their resources and finances in order to support their best version of the story and their relationship with Mozart.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "name": "Risk Legacy",
    "year": 2011,
    "description": "This description is spoiler free, containing nothing outside the initial rulebook for the game. Details on why this is important in the description.\n\nRisk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of \u0022red stars\u0022, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).\n\nWhat\u0027s different is that Risk Legacy\u0027 changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction\u0027s two powers, affix that power\u0027s sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it \u0026ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: \u0022If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.\u0022 This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older \u0022match three symbols\u0022 style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.\n\nThe rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.\n\nThe winner of each of the first 15 games receives a \u0022major bonus,\u0022 such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.\n\nIt should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a \u0022disposable\u0022 game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique.\n\nInitial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.\n\n",

    "description": "In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible. Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.\n\nThe more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?\n\nRailroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add new special rules to your games. The Deep Blue Edition includes the Rivers and Lakes expansions. Increase the difficulty by adding the River route into the mix, or use the Lakes to connect your networks by ferry. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different. Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!\n\n",

Oceans depicts the boundaries between the known world near the ocean\u0026rsquo;s surface, and the mysteries lurking in Earth\u0026rsquo;s deepest unexplored region. Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysterious interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown.  The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun\u0027s energy through photosynthesis. Every other species in the ocean is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded Apex Predator. And even bigger than Apex Predators are enormous Whales that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path. This ecosystem mimics the known world near the surface. But there is more if you are willing to dive deeper.\n\nOceans is an interactive engine builder, where players evolve their species in a continually changing ecosystem. Players must adapt their interconnected ecosystem to survive against the inevitable march of time (Aging), as well as a multitude of predators looking for food.\n\nDuring the first half of the game, players use traits from a deck of Surface cards to modify their species. These traits were chosen for their rich thematic interconnections, providing synergistic card play that mimics an oceanic ecosystem. The Surface traits bring stability to the game environment. During the second half of the game, players can use power cards from The Deep to disrupt the stability. With over 100 unique traits in The Deep, players will slowly discover game-altering traits over the course of many games. These traits were designed to evoke wonder and disbelief - to spark your imagination as you consider the fantastic synergies that are possible in Oceans.\n\nAdditionally, there are 2 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate and deactivate at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game.\n\n",

    "description": "Developer Stefan Br\u0026uuml;ck at alea describes Las Vegas as \u0022an easy, dice-rolling, fun-and-luck game with a lot of interaction and \u0027schadenfreude\u0027\u0022. Who doesn\u0027t love schadenfreude? (Well, other than those being schadened, I suppose...)\n\nIn more detail, Las Vegas includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.\n\nEach player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked \u00221\u0022. You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the money associated with it. In case of a tie, the next non-tied player takes the highest-valued money card at that casino.\n\nLas Vegas rates a 1 out of 10 on alea\u0027s difficulty scale.\n\n",

    "description": "The merchant players in Port Royal, which won the Austrian Game Designers Competition under the title H\u0026auml;ndler der Karibik, are trying to earn as much as they can out of the Caribbean Sea, but if they set their goals too high, they might take home nothing for the day.\n\nThe 120-card deck depicts a coin on the back of each card \u0026mdash; with players earning and paying coins throughout the game \u0026mdash; and different items on the card fronts. On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them in the harbor (an area near the deck). Each card shows one of the following:\n\n\n     Person, who stays in a face-up row next to deck.\n     Ship, which the player can attack immediately if he has enough swords on his people cards, after which the ship is discarded; otherwise, the ship stays in the harbor.\n     Expedition, which remains above the harbor until a player fulfills it by discarding people who have the items required for the expedition.\n     Tax Increase, which forces everyone with twelve or more coins to discard half their money, after which the card is discarded.\n\n\nIf the player draws a ship with the same name as a ship already in the harbor, he\u0027s spent too much time dilly-dallying and his turn ends (after using the ship to attack, if possible), with all the cards in the harbor being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then use/acquire one card if three or fewer ships are in the harbor, two cards if four ships are present, and three cards if five ships are present. Players rob ships, collecting the number of coins shown on them, then discarding the card, while they hire people, paying the number of coins depicted. After the active player takes his 1-3 cards, each other player may pay the active player one coin in order to take one card in the same way.\n\nWhen one player has at least twelve influence points \u0026mdash; which are on both people and expedition cards \u0026mdash; the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most influence points wins.\n\n\u0026bull; Port Royal differs from H\u0026auml;ndler der Karibik in that it includes ten more cards to allow for play with up to five players and players can win without fulfilling an expedition.\n\n",

In an effort to start a new village, the Forever King has selected six citizens for the task, each of whom has a unique set of skills they use to build their charter.\n\nIn Charterstone, a competitive legacy game, you construct buildings and populate a shared village. Building stickers are permanently added to the game board and become action spaces for any player to use. Thus, you start off with simple choices and few workers, but soon you have a bustling village with dozens of possible actions.\n\nYour journey through Charterstone\u0027s many secrets will last twelve games, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t end there. Your completed village will be a one-of-a-kind worker-placement game with plenty of variability.\n\nCharterstone released in the US/Canada on December 12, 2017 (the rest of the world received it slightly earlier).\n\n",

In each round of this abstract tile-laying game, you have to plan your future anew, developing a new strategy to cope with what the moon wheel has to offer you.\n\nOn each turn, you have to decide which new tile from the moon wheel to place in front of you. Every new tile brings a new task you have to fulfill. In order to do so, you need to place tiles of the correct color adjacent to the task you want to complete, but these of course again bring you new tasks. Each time a task is solved, you may place one of your markers on it. So decide wisely and be the first one to place all your markers.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "After a successful bank heist, you and your fellow thieves are laying low and enjoying the good life. Most of the cash has been hidden away, and the rest has been invested in businesses throughout the city. Everything is going according to plan until the police get a breakthrough in their investigation. Accusations are made, fingers are pointed, and after a heated argument, you decide to go your separate ways.\n Chaos ensues as the SWAT team is called in and start to close off the city\u0026rsquo;s exits. Your only choice now is to escape the city before it is completely locked down. But you need a plan \u0026mdash; a good route that allows you to leave the city while recovering as much of the money as possible.\n You will need to call in some favors and hire the local gangs to create diversions. Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn\u0027t cheap. Disguises may help, but they don\u0026rsquo;t fool everyone. Setting the Police on the trail of your former colleagues will give you a better chance of escape, but the other thieves are thinking the same thing...\n Will you escape the city with the most money, or will the Police lockdown the city before you can escape?\n\nIn Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops\u0027 moves every turn. The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves. The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan \u0026mdash; by force if necessary. The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down. The players take actions that allow them to move and to engage gangs, mules, and snitches.\n\nIt contains asymmetric roles set by missions that players may achieve during the game while avoiding the police. The players\u0027 roles as thieves are individual with every player for themselves. In the end, only the player who escapes with the most cash wins.\n\nThe game design is influenced by great heist films.\n\n",

    "description": "In Ingenious, a.k.a. Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player\u0027s score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.\n\nIn more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)\n\nWhen no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.\n\nIngenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner\u0027s tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.\n\n",

    "description": "In the fast and goofy family game Galaxy Trucker, players begin by simultaneously rummaging through the common warehouse, frantically trying to grab the most useful component tiles to build their spaceship \u0026mdash; all in real-time.\n\nOnce the ships are launched, players encounter dangerous situations while vying for financial opportunities, each hoping to gain the most valuable cargo and finish with as much of their ship still intact as possible. Of course, that\u0027s easier said than done since many hazards will send pieces of your ship, your cargo, and your crew hurling into the depths of space.\n\nThe goal is to survive the trek \u0026mdash; hopefully with at least some of your crew and ship intact \u0026mdash; and have at least one credit by the end of the game. (Profit, yay!) Players earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, having the best-looking ship, and reaching their destination before the others.\n\nThis version of Galaxy Trucker is a relaunch of the original 2007 release by Vlaada Chv\u0026aacute;til that features new art, more ship tiles, tweaked card effects, and streamlined gameplay that consists of only a single flight through space. That said, should you want a longer, more challenging experience, you can play a three-flight game known as the \u0022Transgalactic Trek\u0022.\n\n",

Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!\n\nAn exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero\u0027s path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.\n\nIn City of the Ancients, players will encounter portals to the otherworld on the Plains of Targa, finding an ancient frozen city whose living inhabitants are nowhere to be found.  Instead, great mechanical keepers wander the city going about their duties - until interrupted by the arrival of the players\u0027 characters!\n\nSo load up yer\u0027 six shooter, throw on yer\u0027 hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell\u0027s about to break loose...in the Shadows of Brimstone!\n\nCan be used together with Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death to raise the maximum players to 6.\n\n",

The three types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture any more. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: \u0026ldquo;Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?\u0026rdquo; Meaning: Will you capture an opponent\u0026rsquo;s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!\n\nTZAAR replaced TAMSK as part of project GIPF, which was felt to not quite fit in with the others due to its use of sand timers.\n\n",

The game includes carriers and fighters, mines, cloaking, a very large technology tree, fifteen ship classes, merchant shipping, colonization, mining, terraforming, bases, shipyards, black holes, warp points, and non-player aliens.

It wasn\u0026rsquo;t. In the Middle East and South Asia, an Islamic revival was underway. Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions\u0026rsquo; anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West. Wealthy Saudi fanatic Usama bin Ladin issued a declaration of holy war against America in 1996 and then fired the first shots with spectacular terrorist attacks in 1998 and 2000. By 2001, al-Qaeda had set in motion even more devastating strikes \u0026mdash; this time within the US Homeland \u0026mdash; that Bin Ladin hoped would light off a global Muslim uprising. Uprising or not, the Western response to those September 11th attacks would reshape international affairs from London to Jakarta and from Moscow to Dar es Salaam.\n\nLabyrinth takes players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror. With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists\u0026rsquo; use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle \u0026mdash; guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more.\n\n--description from publisher\n\n",

    "description": "X-Wing Second Edition puts you in command of your own squadron of advanced starfighters locked in thrilling, tactical space combat. Following in the footsteps of the first edition, the second edition refines the intuitive and exciting core formula of maneuvering your ships into position by placing a central focus on the visceral thrill of flying starships in the Star Wars galaxy.\n\nDuring a battle, you\u0026rsquo;ll use your squadron\u0026rsquo;s unique capabilities to give yourself an advantage in the thick of combat. Each X-Wing ship flies differently, with its own set of maneuvers ranging from gentle banks to aggressive Koiogran turns. As in the game\u0026rsquo;s first edition, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use every ship\u0026rsquo;s maneuvering capabilities to the fullest in order to strategically position your ships. A round begins with players secretly selecting a maneuver on each of their ships\u0026rsquo; unique maneuver dials. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve decided how each of your ships is going to fly, you\u0026rsquo;ll begin revealing the dials and moving your ships, starting with the lowest skilled pilots.\n\nAs you move, you\u0026rsquo;ll enter a tense duel with your opponent as you both try to line up the perfect shot. Before you can open fire on an opponent\u0026rsquo;s ship, however, they must be in your firing arc and within range. By carefully selecting your maneuvers, you can get enemy ships in your sights, and once you\u0026rsquo;ve locked onto your target, you\u0026rsquo;re free to choose your plan of attack. You might pepper the enemy with blaster fire to whittle away their shields. Or, you could go for massive damage and launch a devastating volley of proton torpedoes. No matter how you approach the battle, you have complete control of your squadron. One player wins when all of their opponent\u0026rsquo;s ships are destroyed!\n\nSlick flying is certainly important, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t the only consideration you\u0026rsquo;ll have to make in the midst of a dogfight. As in the first edition of X-Wing, once your ships have completed a maneuver, you can also perform an action to gain the upper hand. Whether you choose to acquire a target lock on a rival ship or barrel roll out of an enemy\u0026rsquo;s firing arc, the actions you take affect the course of the battle and determine the fate of your squadron.\n\nNow, in the second edition of the game, your actions offer greater strategic depth than ever before. Some actions are red and induce stress when they are used. Other actions may be linked, allowing you to chain two actions together and push the limits of how your ship can handle in a dogfight!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Detective: City of Angels, set in the dark and violent world of 1940s Los Angeles, is a game of mystery, deception, and investigation for 1\u0026ndash;5 players. Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.\n\nDetective: CoA uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O\u0027Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy\u0027s Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they\u0027re wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.\n\nDetective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and \u0022hot\u0022 leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.\n\nInspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a murder-mystery game unlike any other. Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.\u0027s latest high profile murder? Or will The Chisel sow enough doubt and confusion to prevent the detectives from solving the crime?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\nA \u0022sleuth\u0022 mode allows 1 or more players to play fully cooperatively, solving the cases together.\n\n",

Each player will control several creature/power combinations over the course of the game \u0026ndash; spending points to draft these combinations \u0026ndash; and will use those creatures to claim control of various subterranean locations. Some locations hold relics or are designated as \u0022places of power\u0022, and monsters must first be conquered before a player can claim these special benefits. At the end of each turn, a player scores points for the regions he holds, and the player with the most points at game end wins.\n\nSmall World Underground is playable on its own, but can be combined with other Small World releases.

    "description": "The Birth of America series continues with The American Revolution.\n\nIn 1775: Rebellion, players take the roles of the American Continental Army and Patriots against the British Army and the Loyalists. Each side tries to control the colonies, provinces and territories. They call on the aid of Native Americans, as well as the German Hessians and French Army in order to successfully birth a revolution or quell the rebellion. The four factions each use their own deck of cards to move their units into positions. Battles are resolved quickly with custom dice. If you can control an entire colony, province or territory you raise a flag. When the game ends with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the side with the most flag markers is the winner.\n\n1775: Rebellion uses the same basic mechanisms as 1812: The Invasion of Canada, but to a different end result. The game is quicker (being 2-4 player) and the intermingling of units at the beginning of the game allows the action to start immediately. There are a few core rules that changed in order to better portray the goals of the war.\n\nThe game also comes with an advanced scenario, \u0022The Siege of Quebec\u0022. We recommend this for players comfortable with the basic rules.\n\nWinner of BGG \u0022Golden Geek 2013\u0022 Award for \u0022Best Wargame.\u0022\n\n",

Reveal these cards to all players, after which players draft a betting ticket from those on display, then in reverse order draft a second bet. For each bet, you can play it safe \u0026mdash; or flip it to the risky side, which might pay out more - or cost you money if you lose. After betting, each player chooses one of three cards in their hand to secretly add to the racing deck.\n\nShuffle the deck, burn three cards, then reveal cards one by one from the deck, moving the mascots along the track, with them sometimes swerving into another lane and knocking over another racer, sometimes turning around, sometimes all moving at once, and sometimes just going backwards! If a racer runs off the track or would be knocked over while already fallen, they\u0027re disqualified. If needed, shuffle all cards in the deck, burn three cards again, and keep racing until all four spots on the box podium are filled. Pay out bets based on these results.\n\nFor races #2-3, first deal each player a random card from the deck, then place bets again, then have each player contribute a card from their hand to the deck. After race #3, everyone tallies their money.\n\n",

The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win \u0026mdash; should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don\u0027t run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who\u0027s going to run when?

On each leg, players pick one betting card for each color camel, showing how many coins they will win/lose, depending on the camel\u0027s position after the leg.  The dice are then rolled in the pyramid dice roller, which allows one die to come out at a time and moves the matching color camel.  Players can also place oasis cards to earn extra coins.  After all 5 camels are moved, bets are resolved and a new leg start.  Play continues until a camel passes the finish line.\n\nOnce a camel crossess the finish line, all end of race bets are resolved and the player with the most coins wins.\n\n",

Lord Vetinari has disappeared and different factions are trying to take control of the city. Each player has a secret personality with specific victory conditions, which means that you\u0027re not sure exactly what the other players need to do in order to win.\n\nThe action takes place on a map of Ankh-Morpork, with players trying to place minions and buildings through card play. Each of the 132 cards is unique, and \u0022the cards bring the game to life as they include most of the famous characters that have appeared in the various books. The rules are relatively simple: Play a card and do what it says. Most cards have more than one action on them, and you can choose to do some or all of these actions. Some cards also allow you to play a second card, so you can chain actions\u0022 (Wallace).\n\nA team of artists have recreated the city and its residents for the cards, game board and box, with Bernard Pearson coordinating that team. Ankh-Morpork has been sublicensed to Mayfair Games for the North American market and Kosmos for the German market.\n\n",

    "description": "Fleet: The Dice Game is an exciting new strategic roll and write dice game from the creators of Fleet! Fleet: The Dice Game is heavier than many roll and write games and captures the tense, meaningful decisions of Fleet. Fleet: The Dice Game is for 1-4 players.\n\nIn Fleet: The Dice Game, you are back in beautiful Ridback Bay to reap its rewards! Fleet: The Dice Game takes place over 10 rounds with each round having two phases, the Boat Phase and the Town Phase.\n\nIn the boat phase, the active player rolls players plus one boat dice. In turn order, each player selects one die to use immediately. By selecting a boat die, they get to check off the matching boat type on their sheet - unlocking license powers and boat launches to catch fish. The die that remains after all players have selected is then used by all players.\n\nIn the town phase, you roll town dice equal to players plus one boat die. Again, in turn order each player selects one die to use immediately. In the town phase, you unlock special buildings in the Wharf that grant bonuses, awesome ships in the harbor to earn points and catch more fish, or go to the market and gain income to generate bonus actions. The die that remains after all players have selected is then used by all players.\n\nFishing occurs between phases in the even rounds and the player with the most points at game end wins!\n\nFleet: The Dice Game also features a fully integrated solo mode where you battle Captain Ruth to earn the most points and reap the rewards of Ridback Bay.\n\n",

    "description": "Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).  The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.\n\nSetting: Jamaica, 1675.\nAfter a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former \u0022colleagues\u0022 to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the \u0022good old days,\u0022 Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.\n\nGoal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player\u0027s ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.\n\nGameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five \u0022holds\u0022 of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as \u0022captain,\u0022 with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the \u0022day\u0022 and which to the \u0022night.\u0022 Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to \u0022day\u0022 - and one on the right (\u0022night\u0022). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain\u0027s. When it is a player\u0027s turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a \u0022combat\u0022 die, but players may improve their chances by using \u0022gunpowder\u0022 tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.\n\n",

A series of unique Dreams await to be discovered through tense exploration and tactical encounters.\n\nLearn about the Dreamers, their forgotten past, and their desperate mission. Uncover the surreal, sprawling dreamscapes. Just don\u0027t be surprised when---just like dreams often do---they become a little disturbing... Prepare to be challenged by escape-room like riddles. Spot a clue in the image. See a hidden link between several pieces of information. Use your instinct as much as your logic.\n\nIn the beginning, you\u0027ll explore the Dreamworld, trying to find out what this is all about and who you are \u0026ndash; and you are there for a specific reason, but, at first, you can\u0027t remember too much. You\u0027ll have to restore your memories from scattered pieces.\n\nThe rules are pretty straightforward at the beginning, but they will grow more and more complex during the campaign. New rules open new possibilities and, sometimes, may turn everything upside down.\n\nDeckbuilding in Etherfields applies to almost every deck in the game, not only the players\u0027 ones. If you want to know more, enter the Dreamworld. It may be dark here and there, but it certainly isn\u0027t gray. Then, look around and ask yourself: what if we all live in a vast, shared dream?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "The robots of the RoboRally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they\u0027ve chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. \n\nIn RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player\u0027s desire.\n\nIn general, players will first fill all of their robot\u0027s \u0022registers\u0022 with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don\u0027t act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can\u0027t reprogram any cards to fix it!\n\nRobots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.\n\nThe game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.\n\nUPC 742818050029\n\n",

Smaller, more aggressive railroads like the Wabash spring up to further expand America\u0027s extensive railroads.

Score points for collecting the most sushi rolls or making a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! And once you\u0027ve eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you\u0027ve got! But be careful which sushi you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!\n\nSushi Go! takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of \u0022draft and pass\u0022 are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you\u0027ll go for. Then, each turn you\u0027ll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!\n\n",

    "description": "1846 is an 18xx game that traces the westward expansion of railways across the Midwestern United States.\n\nAs in other 18XX games, the winner is the player with the greatest combined wealth (cash on hand \u002B value of stock held \u002B value of private companies owned) at the end of the game.  Play proceeds in a series of stock rounds, each followed by a pair of operating rounds.  In stock rounds, players act as investors buying and selling stock in corporations.  During operating rounds, corporations will lay track, build stations, run trains for revenue to be paid out as dividends or withheld, and buy trains.  The majority shareholder of each corporation acts at its president, making all decisions during operating rounds.  Players will continue operating companies, collecting dividends, and reinvesting until the bank breaks.\n\n1846 features several unique elements, such as scaling the number of corporations, private companies, and bank size to the number of players.  Additionally, the traditional starting private company auction has been replaced with a private company draft, introducing hidden information and a degree of randomness.  Corporations that run a train from the East coast to the West will receive additional revenue.  Moreover, virtually all track builds will incur costs, bringing corporate capitalization and long term financing questions to the fore.\n\nAn unofficial 2-player variant from the designer has been made available in the files section.\n\n",

In Freedom: The Underground Railroad, players are working to build up the strength of the Abolitionist movement through the use of notable figures and pivotal events. By raising support for the cause and moving slaves to freedom in Canada, the minds of Americans can be changed and the institution of slavery can be brought down.\n\nFreedom is a card-driven, cooperative game for one to four players in which the group is working for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.\n\nPlayers need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.\n\nThe goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group\u0027s progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations.\n\nThrough careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time.\n\n",

Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.\n\nIf one threat shows up too many times, the team fails the mission. The team must play their threats correctly in order to gain any progress. However, most of the information in a players hand remains secret throughout the game.\n\nPlanning, teamwork, and a little luck are the tools you\u0027ll need to win this cooperative game for two to five players.\n\n",

The game truly shines in a League format, where players gain experience and learn new skills as they play.\n\nThe latest rules are now version 6.0. The biggest change is the new Inducement system that does an infinitely better job of balancing teams of different experience. All of the team rosters have also been tweaked, with the previous runaway leaders toned down to everyone else\u0027s level. And as a great benefit to teams feeling the need to start over after a first bad game, the Journeyman system ensures you will always have 11 players on the field.\n\nThis game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series\n\n",

Once you arrive on the island, each player will lead an expedition team of four adventurers. Now you just have to navigate your way through the dense jungle to make it to the temples. \u0026bdquo;Just\u0026ldquo; may be something of an understatement; the ancient jungle trails have to be found and uncovered first! Hurry up and be the first to reach the temples to collect the most valuable treasures. Many paths have dead ends and you need to be patient to find the right/best way (through the jungle). Look! A gold nugget! You can pick it up and collect it, same applies to the shiny crystals along the paths.\n\n",

In addition to this, you must be careful of how you make your way through this earthly world to be sure that Osiris will grant you passage to Aaru, the long-awaited heavenly paradise of the afterlife.\n\nThroughout three eras, by means of a novel selection of actions that combine worker placement and tile drafting, players choose on each turn which area of Egyptian life and culture they wish to develop. Players must attempt to obtain the greatest number of prestige points in each era since only the one who manages to achieve the most prestige will take the victory.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In his last will, your rich uncle stated that all of his millions will go to the nephew who can enjoy money the most. How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you\u0027re the first to run through the money on hand, you\u0027ll receive the rest of his inheritance \u0026ndash; oh, and win the game.\n\nIn Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.\n\nEach player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:\n\n\n    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.\n    Draw a card from any regular deck \u0026ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.\n    Visit the opera and spend $2.\n    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.\n    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.\n\n\nPlayers then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses \u0026ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! \u0026ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.\n\nAt the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.\n\nIf a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.\n\n",

Moon and publisher ABACUSSPIELE.\n\nMore than two decades after the publication of that game, Moon and ABACUSSPIELE present Airlines Europe, the design of which Moon began in 2007. According to the publisher, \u0022He wanted to preserve the feel of the original game and its successor, Union Pacific, while confronting the player with even more exciting choices.\u0022 The result of that redesign process is Airlines Europe, featuring a reduced playing time, a new point structure, a European setting, and 112 tiny detailed airplanes.\n\nAt its heart, Airlines Europe is a stock game, with players earning points for the stock they hold in particular airline companies when one of the randomly determined scorings takes place. On a player\u0027s turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank. A player scores only for stock in play, but the value of an airline is determined by the value of the route licenses that airline owns  \u0026ndash; thus, you\u0027re torn in terms of what to play when.\n\nSome changes compared to Airlines:\n\n\n     map of Europe\n     no flight cards \n     special Air ABACUS airline similar to the Union Pacific \n     share track system\n     separate victory point and money systems\n     airplane miniatures\n     no sabotage \n     up to 5 players\n     reduced playtime\n\n\nSome changes compared to Union Pacific:\n\n\n     airplane theme\n     map of Europe\n     no track cards\n     Air ABACUS is acquired by trading in other shares\n     share track system \n     separate victory point and money systems\n     up to 5 players\n     reduced playtime \n\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Airlines\n    Union Pacific\n\n\nPromo Expansions:\n\n    Airlines Europe: Flight Ban (adding the option to block routes)\n    Airlines Europe: New Bonus Connections (adding bonus connections for the black and the brown airline)\n    Airlines Europe: The Presidents (adds tie breaker for stock payouts)\n\n\n",

With resources running low you jump through warp gate after warp gate hoping to find the right combination home.\n\nBut home is not what you find. The warp takes you further out in the galaxy than the Force has ever gone. You are deep behind enemy lines and find yourself on the edge of a blackhole... and on the doorstep of the enemy\u0026rsquo;s mighty mothership.\n\nYou have a moment of bravery and approach the enemy\u0026rsquo;s fleet. Just maybe you can get through them and destroy the mothership... but before you have a chance to react the enemy is already upon you. Lasers fire. Photon cannons pierce through the blackness. A moment later your shields are gone, your laser battery empty, and your hull damaged. Your powerless ship splits apart as you fall from the enemy and into the black hole below.\n\nJust as your ship crests gravity\u0026rsquo;s edge you and infinite blackness takes hold... you are back where you started. The enemy fleet is before you. The mothership looming in the distance. And, most importantly, your laser battery is full. You have a second chance at the edge of space and now you know what\u0026rsquo;s coming...\n\nWarp\u0026rsquo;s Edge is a solo bag-building game of space combat. Pilot one of four starfighters, which each have their own unique weapon loadouts. You\u0026rsquo;ll be facing off against one of five alien motherships and its accompanying fleet. Every matchup offers a different challenge, pushing you toward new strategies and tactics. You have a limited number of warps to succeed, so choose wisely as you improve your arsenal and learn new skills!\n\nIn the box you will also find a 28-page choose-your-path storybook, Singularity, written by Banana Chan. This sets the stage for the events of the game and reveals Taylor\u0026rsquo;s backstory. You can even customize the game setup based on the narrative choices you make!\n\n",

Gather heroes and powerful artifacts, please the gods and bear their power to write your own epic tale.\n\nLet your allies achieve their destiny and enter the Elysium, home of the glorious and the brave. Once the stories are written, only one demigod will be chosen to stand at the side of Zeus.\n\nElysium is a game of set collecting and combinations in which players recruit cards representing heroes, items, powers and gods. These cards have many different powers and you can create powerful combination to earn gold (the help of the gods) and victory points (the favor of the gods). Each card belongs to one of the eight Olympians gods (a family), and shows a level (1 to 3).\n\nDuring the five turns of the game, players will try to transfer their cards to the Elysium and write their own Legends, which are series of cards from the same family or from different families of the same level. The more epic the Legends, the more favor from the gods they\u0026rsquo;ll earn. But as they go to Elysium, most cards lose their power and players will therefore have to renounce some of their combinations !\n\nA game of balance and opportunity with  simple action, but constant dilemmas and complex strategies.\n\n",

Now with 3 types of roles: witches, druids, and gatherers.\n    Drizzelda, the weather fairy, helps chase away the bad weather.\n    New illustrations and game pieces.\n    Same style of play, and by the same game designer as Witch\u0026rsquo;s Brew.\n    New version also includes a 2-player version.\n\n\nThe game is played over 7 rounds, with 4 turns per round. Each round, players simultaneously select 4 of their 10 role cards, and then they take turns playing one role at a time. Each role has a brave action and a cowardly action; the brave action is stronger, but riskier, as another player could steal the action from you later; the cowardly action is safer, but not as robust. How well can you bluff your opponents?\n\nUse the gatherer roles to collect ingredients to make potions, the witch roles to zoom around on your broom to different areas, and the witch or druid roles to deliver the potions, collecting victory points as you go. Chase away lightning clouds with the help of the weather fairy, and keep an eye on the event cards that change game play, one event per round.\n\nThe winner is the player with the most victory points after all 7 rounds are complete and end-of-game bonus points have been awarded.\n\n",

Will you be able to save your people in time?\n\nAtlantis Rising is a co-operative worker placement game in which you must work together with up to six other players to deploy citizens across your homeland, gathering resources in order to build a cosmic gate that can save your people. Workers placed close to the shoreline are more rewarding, but are more likely to be flooded and the actions lost.\n\nEvery turn, each player draws a misfortune card that will flood certain locations along the ever-shrinking Atlantis shoreline, or may otherwise work to undermine your efforts to save your people. So you must race to gather the necessary resources to build and power the gate, before the island disappears beneath the waves forever.\n\nThis edition contains all new art and graphic design, created to bring even more attention to the thematic setting of the game. The Athenians Attack phase has been replaced with the Wrath of the Gods phase, requiring more strategic planning and adding to the sense of urgency. Now, instead of placing workers in an Atlantean Navy, players must cooperatively decide to flood a set number of tiles at the end of each round. To further aid them in their task, Councilor player powers have been expanded and made more impactful, and the knowledge deck has similarly been revised and expanded. The variable gate components, once built, no longer offer one-time bonuses, but create new worker placement spots where players can send Atlantean workers to unleash actions to help save their island.\n\n",

Luxury lines scramble to accommodate the needs of business tycoons, diplomats, and even royalty. Step into this world and compete to build the most luxurious train lines possible in First Class. Guide your lines from humble beginnings into rivals of the fabled Orient Express itself as you carry out actions each round. Add cars to your trains, upgrade those cars to attract wealthier clientele, extend your lines towards Constantinople, and more. A limited number of action cards is available each round, so pick your actions carefully and choose a path for your rail lines. There are many ways to score points, but only a true railroad baron will accumulate the most points and win the game.\n\nFirst Class is a card game that includes aspects of board games, creating a unique and dynamic experience every time you play. Cards represent your train cars and provide a visual reminder of your empire\u0027s growth as they extend out from your player board. On top of that, every game of First Class uses two of five interchangeable decks of action cards. Each deck provides new challenges for building your rail empire. One game might have you catering to the celebrities on your trains and fulfilling contracts along your route, while another game asks you to accommodate passengers and their luggage while you get swept up in a murder mystery. Each combination of modules opens many possible strategies and provides even more thematic flair. Return to a time when rail was king and grow your empire!\n\n",

To secure Andor\u0027s borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.\n\nAt the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or \u0022Legend\u0022, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board\u0027s legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story\u0027s plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.\n\nWill their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm?

    "year": 2013,
    "description": "You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they\u0027ve ever known, and you may use them at your whim.\n\nThe world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.\n\nThe Euphorians aren\u0026rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand\u0026mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.\n\nThere is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they\u0026rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.\n\nIn Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.\n\nEuphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker\u0027s knowledge\u0026mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he\u0027s in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.\n\nYour path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts\u0026mdash;especially matching pairs\u0026mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.\n\nFour distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?\n\n",

    "description": "In Take 5, a.k.a. 6 nimmt!, Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.\n\nTo play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that\u0027s below the card\u0027s number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.\n\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!\n\n6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use only the lowest 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. players. This change allows you to know exactly which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and know what to expect so that you can (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.\n\n",

    "description": "London lies devastated after the Great Fire of 1666. This is your opportunity to build a new city on the ashes of the old. It is up to you how you employ the talents of the people of London to this end. Will you favor the business classes, who will earn you money? Or would you prefer to spend more money than you can rightly afford on grand monuments and sumptuous palaces? You must also deal with the problem of rising poverty and how to employ the many paupers of the city. Throughout the game you will be forced to make tough decisions. To achieve one aim you must sacrifice another, which may open an opportunity for a competitor.\n\nLondon is a 2-4 player game with a playing time of approximately 90 minutes. Players select cards with varying powers of cashflow, victory points, and poverty penalties, and compete to manage them most efficiently. Nearly 250 years of progress is glimpsed in this game. Famous buildings and monuments of the era as well as engineering developments such as streetlights are illustrated on the cards.\n\nAs with a lot of games, London is about scoring the most VPs.  Players manage their hand, selecting cards to play into their building display by laying them out in a line.  At some point a player will choose to run his city. They can activate their buildings in whatever order they prefer.  The resulting actions can generate money and VPs, reduce poverty or have some other effect specified on the card.  Some cards have an entry cost which must be paid before the action can be performed.\n\n",

A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse!\n\nSentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.\n\nEach player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which \u0022play themselves\u0022, requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player\u0027s turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.\n\n",

    "description": "Publisher blurb\n\nIncluding a total of 180 plastic figures and dozens of unit types, Starcraft: The Board Game features an innovative modular board of varying sizes, which guarantees a new experience each and every game. An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.\n\nDescription\n\nIn StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and \u0022Z-Axis\u0022 connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).\n\nEach player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.\n\nEach turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player\u0027s turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn\u0027t over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.\n\nPlayers can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use.\n\n\u0022Reimplements\u0022\n\n     StarCraft (video game)\n\n\n",

The game boasts a hexagonal board that is set up differently every time, as well as (in the Avalon Hill edition) cool \u0022glow\u0022 miniatures and lots of combat. Players control competing  futuristic corporations that battle each other for control of the moon\u0027s Rubium Ore. By winning battles and fulfilling Secret Missions, you can obtain victory points.\n\nUnits are composed of various alien races and have stats similar to those used in the Axis \u0026 Allies series. Combat is also similar. Players who lose battles are compensated with Energize cards which grant them special powers later. Players can also obtain Energize cards by controlling the Monolith, a raised structure in the center of the grid. The first person to reach the required number of victory points wins the game.\n\n",

    "description": "The walls were lined with iron shelves, each metal slat overfilled with glass jars containing formaldehyde and grotesque curiosities within. Pristine brass tools and refined metals of a quality I had never before laid eyes upon were strewn across sturdy slabs of rock and wood, their edges sharp with use. However, my eyes were soon drawn to a sturdy writing desk, its mahogany eaves inlaid with thin strips of copper, the center of which contained a well-worn leather-bound book. My father\u0027s journal \u0026mdash; passed down to me and representing years of knowledge and countless experiments. And inside that weathered tome, atop the pearly parchment oxidized yellow at its frayed edges, were the deliberate quill marks of a crazed genius outlining the ambitious project he could never complete in one lifetime \u0026mdash; his masterwork.\n\nWithout realizing it, my hands were shaking as I clutched the book to my chest. At once, I felt an ownership and anxiety for the scientific sketches scrawled so eloquently on those frayed sheets. It was at that moment that I began my obsession: I would restore this laboratory to its former brilliance and dedicate my life to completing my father\u0027s work!\n\nIn My Father\u0027s Work, players are competing mad scientists entrusted with a page from their father\u0027s journal and a large estate in which to perform their devious experiments. Players earn points by completing experiments, aiding the town in its endeavors, upgrading their macabre estates, and hopefully completing their father\u0027s masterwork.\n\nBut they have to balance study and active experimentation because at the end of each generation, all of their experiments and resources are lost to time until their child begins again with only the \u0022Journaled Knowledge and Estate\u0022 they have willed to them \u0026mdash; and since the game is played over the course of three generations, it is inevitable that the players will rouse the townsfolk to form angry mobs or spiral into insanity from the ethically dubious works they have created. The player with the most points at the end of three generations wins and becomes the most revered, feared, ingenious scientist the world has ever known!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Northwest India at the beginning of the 18th century. The rule of the Grand Moguls is waning, and the Maharishis and princes seize the opportunity to take control of the region. By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won.\n\nThe goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built.\n\nThere are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly. There are bonus points for connecting palaces over several regions on the map.After the final area on the board is auctioned, the player with the highest point total wins the game.\n\nThis game is #3 in the Alea big box series.\n\nNote: the 2018 edition from Fantasy Flight Games includes rules for 2 players. You use only the cards included in the game, so no additional components are required. Anyone could use these rules with any version of the game.\n\n",

    "description": "Play as trolls rebuilding your abandoned kingdom under the mountain in In the Hall of the Mountain King. With muscle and magic, you\u0027ll unearth riches, dig out collapsed tunnels, and carve out great halls as you raise the toppled statues of your ancestors to their places of honor at the heart of the mountain. Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system. Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown!\n\nWorking on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you\u0027ll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map. You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues. Statues are key to scoring, and you\u0027ll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain.\n\nA major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources \u0026mdash; gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers \u0026mdash; that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a \u0022pyramid\u0022. The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears. The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map.\n\nThe game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!\n\n",

    "description": "Madeira is an island officially discovered early in the 15th century by Portuguese seafarers. Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a \u0026ldquo;laboratory\u0026rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.\n\nWheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.\n\nPlayers try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.\nMadeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.\n\nThe Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.\n\nPlayers must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don\u0026rsquo;t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities. Will you have what it takes to excel in all of these endeavors?\nBeware, wheat may become scarce, money is never enough, the population is hungry, and the shadow of piracy looms large\u0026hellip;.\n\n",

Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s The Lord of the Rings and create their own version of the dramatic conflict between the Dark Lord, Sauron, and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.\n\nIn War of the Ring: The Card Game, up to 4 players compete in two teams, the Shadow against the Free Peoples, each player using a specific and different card deck representing the strengths and weaknesses of the different factions involved in the war.\n\nThe Free Peoples desperately try to complete their quest to destroy the One Ring, while at the same time defending their homelands from the encroaching hordes of Sauron and from his evil allies.\n\nThe Shadow players must strike quickly and decisively, before the Ring-bearers can complete their quest; or try to slowly corrupt Frodo, burdening him with wounds, toil, and the sorrow for the loss of his Companions.\n\nDuring the game, players will take turns playing cards representing the characters, armies, items, and events of the War of the Ring. Each card they play will help or hinder the journey of the Fellowship as it progresses on its Path; or be used to defend or conquer the strongholds of Middle-earth, as they fight to control the new Battleground cards activated in each round.\n\nWith more than 100 original illustrations from the greatest Tolkienian artists in the world, including an amazing gallery of landscapes from The Shire to Mordor by John and Fataneh Howe, War of the Ring: The Card Game is more than a game \u0026ndash; it also a memorable collection for all lovers of the world imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nThis is your chance to forge the destiny of an age, like you never did before!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In Archipelago, players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago. They will explore territories, harvest resources, use those resources in markets both internal (for their use and that of the natives) and foreign (to sell it in Europe), build markets, harbors, cities and temples, and negotiate among themselves (and maybe betray each other) \u0026ndash; all this to complete their secret objectives. They will also need to guess the secret objective of the other players to be able to benefit from them.\n\nBut players also need to be careful of the natives; if they make them too unhappy or if too many of them are unoccupied, they could revolt and declare independence. Then everyone will lose!\n\nAccording to the author, what he\u0027s tried to create is a \u0022German\u0022 economic worker-placement game, but without the two things he dislikes in them: the superficial theme and the lack of interaction. Indeed this game includes a very present theme and a lot of negotiation and potential backstabbing.\n\nThe game includes three sets of objectives, enabling players to choose between a short, medium and a long game. Solo play is also possible with an expansion.\n\n",

You will travel the land seeking your own destiny and fortune. You will learn stories and gain wisdom to share with others. Will you be the first to fulfill your destiny? The next Tale is yours to tell! There is, of course, a winner in Tales of the Arabian Nights, but the point of the game is less to see who wins and more to enjoy the unfolding and telling of a great story!\n\nPlayers choose a character card, a quest, select a set skills, and move across the board to fulfill the quest. A player\u0027s movement is based on their wealth and each player draws an encounter card at the end of their move. Dice are thrown and these determine the player\u0027s responses to the encounter based on their character card. In a very simplified sense, it\u0027s a very big Choose Your Own Adventure game - with the added spice that the players to your right and left control the matrix and the Book of Tales during your encounter - so the game moves along at a good pace. The first player to finish their quest wins.\n\nThe Book of Tales is huge and offers a huge amount of the variability and replayability. Solitaire modules can be purchased separately.\n\n",

    "year": 2015,
    "description": "American baseball was on its last legs as a spectator sport. Football had become the predominant national pastime \u0026mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne!\n\nStarting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or \u0027Borgs as they\u0027re affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding \u0027Bots are on the way.\n\nNow in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it\u0027s hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!\n\nThe stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they \u0027Bots, \u0027Borgs or Naturals!\n\nBaseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV\u0026nbsp;highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each \u0022mini-game\u0022, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game\u0027s highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent\u0027s pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!\n\n",

Survivors must search for five keys or repair the radio while avoiding noise that attracts the killer, collecting items, and managing fear as they attempt to flee the nightmare. Meanwhile, the killer uses terrifying powers to track sound, block paths, and hunt survivors down with brutal efficiency.\n\nWith varied characters on both sides \u0026mdash; each with unique abilities and miniatures \u0026mdash; every match feels different and tense. Games take about 30\u0026ndash;45 minutes, making Terrorscape a quick but gripping horror experience.\n\nFast-paced and atmospheric, Terrorscape throws you straight into a classic horror narrative, where survival is uncertain, trust is fleeting, and every shadow could be your last.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from publisher\n\n",

It started with Rocket Flight (1999), a game with the vision to let \u0022Each player start as a spacefaring company in the year 2020 trying to make a profit in trade and technology development.\u0022 Now that we are at that year, High Frontier has evolved into a modular system open to enthusiasts to keep it updated ever farther into the future.\n\nThe Core Game is equivalent to the previous edition\u0027s basic and advanced rules, and includes Module 0 (Politics). It also comes with the beginner\u0027s game Space Diamonds (accessible to bright children), Race for Glory (introductory, including a playthrough), and a variety of solitaire and cooperative variants. The iconic map of High Frontier is the most comprehensive map of the solar system ever published! Since it is a delta-v map, it offers a completely different view of the accessibility of the worlds that orbit Sol. The cards and map have been expanded and produced in consultation with experts in the field, and the author himself is a former rocket scientist, and we can safely say this is the most accurate yet accessible game of space exploration/exploitation ever published. Transition rules allow High Frontier to work as an independent 4th stage in the Bios:Earth trilogy (Bios: Genesis, Bios: Megafauna, and BIOS: Origins) about the evolution of life on our planet.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Tests of his new invention, the Weather Machine, showed positive results. Visions of quelling floods, subduing cyclones, and ending droughts made him smile.\n\nIn Weather Machine, you are scientists on Prof. Lativ\u0026rsquo;s team, tampering with local weather: adjusting rainfall for farms, maintaining wind and clear skies for ecological energy sources, and tweaking the temperature for resorts and sporting events. The prototype is quite effective so far; however, a pattern has emerged, revealing a worrying side effect: Each use of the Weather Machine also alters the conditions elsewhere on the planet \u0026mdash; a \u0026ldquo;butterfly effect\u0026rdquo;.\n\n\u0022We must build a new prototype,\u0026rdquo; he announces as the agents shoot him sidelong glances; \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;but this time we\u0026rsquo;re going to get it right.\u0026rdquo; The agents silently give a single, crisp nod of confirmation. \u0026ldquo;The government is funding this, and we will succeed.\u0026rdquo; As Prof. Lativ explains the plan, the need to secure suppliers for sufficient bots and chemicals is clear. In addition to the materials, time is of the essence; you must be focused and efficient to have any hope of reining this growing global terror, Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere before conditions are too harsh for Homo sapiens and other species.\n\nNote: The solo mode is NOT included in the base game\u0027s box. It is part of Weather Machine: Upgrade Pack.\n\n",

All of Rome has borne witness to the grandest spectacles the empire has ever seen \u0026mdash; all to commemorate the opening of the Amphitheatrum Flavium, the Colosseum.\n\nTens of thousands have flocked to the city to experience the sight of a hundred gladiators in battle...rare and exotic animals prowling the arena floor...and to hear and see the greatest musicians and entertainers from throughout the empire.

    "description": "Dice Throne is a game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful heroes, and unique abilities.\n\nIt\u0027s a fast-paced 2-6 player combat game (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all). Select from a variety of heroes that play and feel completely distinct from one another. Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero\u0027s unique set of five dice. Accumulate combat points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate\u0027s, or even your opponent\u0027s).\n\n\nLet\u0027s take a look at a turn of a 1v1 game.\n\nThe game begins with 2 players selecting their heroes. Player One chooses Moon Elf and player two picks Barbarian. Each player begins the game with 50 HP (Health Points).\n\nPlayer One (the Moon Elf) won the roll to go first. The Moon Elf draws their 4 starting game cards and begins the game with 1 CP (Combat Point). \n\n    Note- The player that wins the starting roll does not draw a card (above their starting hand of 4) or gain CP above their 1 starting CP. \n\n\n\nThe Moon Elf then checks for status effects (like poison, or Burn) to resolve.\n\nThe next phase is called Main Phase (1). This is where the Moon Elf player can upgrade their hero board with cards from their hands if they have enough CP to pay for the upgrades. They can also play any Main Phase Action cards (blue cards).\n\nThen they enter the Offensive Roll Phase. The Moon Elf can take up to 3 roll attempts (with their 5 dice) to accomplish an action or attack from their hero board. After deciding on an action within the 3 roll attempts an action is declared.\n\nThen the Defensive Roll Phase begins where the opponent (Barbarian) can use their defensive roll (as it appears on their hero board). The amount of damage or incoming status affects are resolved and that concludes the Defensive Roll Phase.\n\n\n     During Offensive and Defensive Roll Phase any player can play Roll Phase Action cards from their hand as long as they have the CP to pay for it.\n\n\nThe Moon Elf player enters their second Main Phase where they can do any final hero board upgrades or play blue Main Phase Action cards.\n\nThe Moon Elf then must discard any extra cards over 6 from their hand.\n\nThe Barbarian player begins his turn by drawing one additional card (over his starting hand of 4) and gaining one CP (Combat Point) for a total of 2.\n\nThe Barbarian then follows the same phases the Moon Elf.\n\nThe game alternates hero turns until one player is at 0 Health.\n\nDiceThrone is for 2-6 players, ages 8\u002B, and runs 20-30 minutes for a battle. With the ever expanding gallery of heroes the game feels fresh each time you jump in!\n\n",

    "description": "La Granja: Deluxe Master Set is an upgraded and expanded version of the 2014 game La Granja in which 1\u0026ndash;4 players manage small farms by the Alpich pond near the village of Esporles on Majorca.\n\nThe players must carefully consider the decisions of which dice to draft, which cards to play, when and where to deliver goods to various markets, and how best to utilize the flexible powers afforded by several \u0022anytime\u0022 actions.\n\nThe multi-use cards offer four different options for players to choose from. Decide whether you want to use the card as an extension to your fields (increasing your ability to grow olives, grain, or grapes), as an extension to your farm (increasing the number of pigs you can house, the deliveries you can make, or the coins you will earn each round), as a market barrow (providing a personal contract you can fulfill for valuable rewards), or as a hired helper (each providing a unique and powerful ability to improve your actions).\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGame RoundEach game round follows a consistent and simple structure.\n\n\n     Farm Phase\n         Play a farm card (optional)\n         Draw new card(s)\n         Take income\n         Farm growth (harvest goods and pigs)\n         Purchase roof markers (optional)\n    \n     Revenue Phase\n         Roll revenue dice\n         Draft a revenue die and perform the associated action (in turn order; repeated once)\n         Common action (undrafted revenue die)\n    \n     Transportation Phase\n         Choose donkey marker\n         Advance on siesta track and reset turn order\n         Deliver goods to common markets in the village, or to fulfill personal contracts\n    \n     Scoring Phase\n         Score victory points based on your position on the siesta track\n         Reset the siesta track\n    \n\n\nAt the end of the sixth game round, the game ends, wherafter the players convert remaining farm goods and coin into victory points. The player with the most victory points is crowned the winner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeluxe Master SetWhile La Granja Deluxe Master Set reimplements the beloved original game, it also adds a lot of never-before seen content, including modular expansion content designed by Michael Keller and Andreas \u0022ode.\u0022 Odendahl themselves.\n\nAdditional expansion modules have been designed by Stefan Feld, Adam Kwapi\u0144ski, and Andrei Novac.\n\nMany others have also participated in designing promo cards for La Granja Deluxe Master Set, including Tony Boydell, Mike Murphy, and David Waybright.\n\nThis Deluxe Master Set features brand new artwork, redesigned multi-layer player boards, high quality upgraded components, metal coins, and more.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "HeroQuest is Milton Bradley\u0027s approach to a Dungeons \u0026 Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests. This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop Ltd. who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book. The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.\n\nThe game is played on a grid representing the interior of a dungeon or castle, with walls segmenting the grid into rooms and corridors. One player assumes the role of the evil wizard character (Zargon/Morcar), and uses a map taken from the game\u0027s quest book to determine how the quest is to be played. The map details the placement of monsters, artifacts, and doors, as well as the overall quest the other players are embarking upon. During a Hero\u0027s turn, the player can move before or after performing one of the following actions: attack, cast a spell, search for traps and secret doors, search for treasure.\n\nThe game ends when every player has either returned to the spiral staircase, exited by a door, or been killed by the evil wizard. If the objective of the quest has not been accomplished then the evil wizard character wins. Items collected during the quest may be kept for future quests. The quests usually form part of a longer story, especially the quests which are part of the expansion packs.\n\nAdditional material, which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion, was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.\n\n",

    "description": "A forgotten evil stirs in the ancient land of Varisia. Dark magic once more thrums amid crumbling ruins, giants gather in titanic armies, cultists murder in the name of foul deities, and maniacal goblins plot a fiery end for the peaceful town of Sandpoint.\n\nLaunch a campaign to strike back against the evils plaguing Varisia with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords - Base Set. This complete cooperative strategy card game pits 1 to 4 heroes against the traps, monsters, deadly magic, and despicable foes of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\u0027s award-winning Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path. In this game players take the part of a fantasy character such as a rogue or wizard, each with varying skills and proficiencies that are represented by the cards in their deck. The classic ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) are assigned with different sized dice. Players can acquire allies, spells, weapons, and other items. The goal is to find and defeat a villain before a certain number of turns pass, with the villain being represented by its own deck of cards complete with challenges and foes that must be overcome. Characters grow stronger after each game, adding unique gear and awesome magic to their decks, and gaining incredible powers, all of which they\u0027ll need to challenge greater threats in a complete Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Adventure Path.\n\nThe Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is an expandable game, with the first set containing nearly 500 cards. The Rise of the Runelords - Base Set supports 1 to 4 players; a 110-card Character Add-On Deck expands the possible number of players to 5 or 6 and adds more character options for any number of players. The game will be expanded with bimonthly 110-card adventure decks.\n\nErrata: Early printings had the Loot card \u0022Sihedron Medallion\u0022 listed as belonging to \u0022B\u0022  (for Base Set). It is instead supposed to read \u00221\u0022 (for Burnt Offerings ). (It is unknown if this has been fixed in later printings)\n\n",

    "name": "Triumph \u0026 Tragedy: European Balance of Power 1936-1945",
    "year": 2015,
    "description": "Triumph \u0026 Tragedy is a geopolitical strategy game for 3  players (also playable by 2) covering the competition for European supremacy during the period 1936-45 between Capitalism (the West), Communism (the Soviet  Union) and Fascism (the Axis). It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or  technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily.\n\nThe 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas. Military units are 5/8\u0022 blocks, of 7 types   (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral). The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition. There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types.\n\nThe  game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe. With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out. The  game may end peacefully or there may be war. There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace).\n\nYou can win peacefully by:  \n\u0026bull; Economic Hegemony (total of Production \u002B secret Peace Dividend values \u002B Atomic Research is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR \n\u0026bull; Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages and be able to deliver it to a Main Capital).\n\nIf there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods (with extra Economic Hegemony victory points available), or by:\n\u0026bull; Military Victory (capture TWO enemy capitals out of nine: each player controls three).\n\nEconomic production underlies all forms of power in the game. Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace.\n\nPowers can spend their current economic Production on either: \n\u0026bull; Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR \n\u0026bull; Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR \n\u0026bull; Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels).\n\nBuilding a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production. Simple. You can\u0026rsquo;t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production.\n\nInitially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources. Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition. In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control of minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them. At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces.\n The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: \n\u0026bull; Diplomatic  infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and \n\u0026bull; Industrial buildup (via  Investment cards), with\n\u0026bull; Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents),\n\u0026bull; Technology  advancement (also via Investment cards), and some\n\u0026bull; Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails.\n\nIf  the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold. Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way.\n\nAt  some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another. The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward. The third party may well continue its economic development in peace. Or not.\n\nUnit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that  determines the maximum number of units that can be moved. Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one\u0026rsquo;s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season. But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security.\n\nCombat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits. Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are  targeting (ground, naval, air, sub). Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion. Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move).\n\nTriumph \u0026 Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each other), and only ONE player can win the game. Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable. Alliances are shifting and co-operation is undependable. The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything. There is immense replayability as players can pursue dominance in Europe via land, sea or air military superiority, technological supremacy, or economic hegemony without rivals realizing their strategy until it is TOO LATE! It is a highly interactive, tense, fast-moving game with little downtime between player turns, covering THE crucial geopolitical decade of the 20th century in 4-6 hours.\n\n",

    "description": "In Reiner Knizia\u0027s Mille Fiori (millefiori is a glasswork technique for decorative patterns, the name means Thousand Flowers), you take the role of glass manufacturers and traders who want to profit as much as they can from their role in the production of fine glass art.\n\nThe game board features different aspects of the glass production cycle: workshops where the glass is created, houses where it\u0027s installed, people who support your work, trade shops where it\u0027s sold, and the harbor where ships take the glass to faraway locations. You want to be present in all of these areas, preferably at just the right time to maximize your earnings. The gameboard features 109 spaces, with one card in the deck for each of those spaces.\n\nAt the start of a round, each player receives a hand of five cards. Each player chooses a card from hand, then passes the remaining cards to the next player, then each player plays their card in turn, beginning with the round\u0027s start player and typically placing a diamond-shaped token of their color in the location depicted on that card:\n\n\n     In the Workshops, you score 1 point for each of your tokens in a connected group with the newly placed token, doubling that score if you played on a pigment field.\n     In the Residences, you score the listed number of points, and if your token is preceded in the line by one or more tokens of your color, you score those previously played tokens again.\n     In the Townspeople area, you score 1, 3 or 6 points based on the height of your token in the pyramids, but you can only place at higher levels if the lower spaces are filled. Double your points if the card symbol matches the space your filled. Supporting tokens score again as higher tokens are placed.\n     In the Trade shops, four types of goods are present, and when you place a token, each token on that goods type scores for its owner points equal to the number of goods of that type now covered.\n     In the Harbor, you move your ship equal to the number on the played card, scoring points based on the space where you land, then place a token in one of the five rows. When that row is filled with three ships, each token in that row scores for its owner 1/3/6/10 points depending on the number of trade goods in that row.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can play a card for ship movement points and not place a token on the game board.\n\nEach player plays four cards in a round (in a 3 or 4 player game), then adds the last card in hand to those displayed beside the game board, then the start player marker rotates and you begin a new round.\n\nFor each of the five areas, you can meet a certain condition that allows you to play a bonus card from those beside the game board, e.g., in the Workshops when you place the third card that surrounds a bonus card symbol, or in the Trade shops when you score a goods type that gives someone else more points than you. When you play a bonus card, you might trigger another bonus card... and then another!\n\nAdditionally, there are five different ways to score substantial bonus points for the areas, e.g., in the Residences you need to place tokens on houses of four different values, and in the Townspeople area you need to place tokens on all three types in a pyramid. You can only score each area\u0027s bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.\n\nWhen someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can\u0027t deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.\n\n",

    "description": "You are head of a family in an Italian city-state, a city run by a weak and corrupt court. You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...\n\nIn Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.\n\nEach player starts the game with two coins and two influence \u0026ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:\n\n\n     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.\n     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player\u0027s character.\n     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.\n     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.\n     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.\n\n\nOn your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:\n\n\n     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.\n     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.\n     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)\n\n\nWhen you take one of the character actions \u0026ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else\u0027s action \u0026ndash; that character\u0027s action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can\u0027t (or don\u0027t) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you\u0027re out of the game.\n\nIf you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.\n\nThe last player to still have influence \u0026ndash; that is, a face-down character \u0026ndash; wins the game!\n\nA new \u0026 optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards \u0026 Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.\n\n\n     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck. They then shuffle the old card into the Court deck. Block someone from stealing coins from you.\n\n\n",

Why not get to know the country around a table?   Over six years of harvests, cultivate your vines, choose the best varieties, hire the best oenologists, take part in trade fairs, and show your opponents you are the best winemaker in the game.\n\nThe players, winemakers in Portugal, will develop their vineyards and produce wine to achieve maximum profit.\nThe object of the game is to produce quality wines that can be exchanged for money or victory points.\nThe best wines are then sent to a wine fair in order to achieve fame and win awards.\n\nAwake your senses and have fun making and selling your own wine.\n\nFrom back of Box Cover:\n\nIn Vinhos (a Portuguese word meaning \u0026ldquo;Wines\u0026rdquo;) you will play the role of wine producers in Portugal.\n\nOver a period of 6 years, you will expand your business by establishing Estates in the different regions of Portugal, buying vineyards and building wineries. Skilled enologists will help you increase the quality of your wine, while top Wine Experts will enhance its features at the \u0022Feira Nacional do Vinho Portugu\u0026ecirc;s\u0022, the Wine Tasting Fair.\n\nSelling your wines to Portuguese local hangouts will establish a market presence for your company, help you secure the funds to expand your company, and to pay your enologists\u0026rsquo; salaries.\n\nBut, as everyone knows, prestige cannot come from money alone. To ensure a good reputation on international markets you must meet the requirements of various Countries, by consistently exporting high-quality wines.\n\nPeriodically, a Wine Tasting Fair will be held. It is up to you to decide the best time to announce which wine you intend to present. The choice of the best wine by value and features is essential to the prestige of your company and will definitely make all the difference!\n\nIt is suggested that players do not play their first game with the maximum number of players.\n\nVinhos was previously known as Vin\u0026iacute;cola\n\n",

    "description": "The players are builders in Ancient Egypt, competing to get the most fame building different monuments requested by the Pharaoh (the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Temple, and the Pyramid).\n\nThe game lasts 5 turns. In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.\n\nIn Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that \u0022pawns\u0022 are placed, since \u0022workers\u0022 are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).\n\nWhen the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).\n\nAfter that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.\n\nWhen the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards. Whoever has the highest total is the winner.\n\nOnline Play\n\n\n     Yucata (turn-based)\n\n\n",

The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player\u0027s ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total \u0022cargo load\u0022.\n\nPart of the Knizia auction trilogy.\nOne of the Knizia Florentine auction games.\n\n Related Games: \n\n\n     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)\n     Strozzi\n     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).\n\n\n",

    "description": "For generations, the rats in the old junkyard have been telling each other the great legend about a moon made out of cheese and they want nothing more than to reach this inexhaustible treasure. One day, the little rat children discovered a comic in the junkyard that described the first landing on the moon, and thus the plan was born: Build a rocket and take over the cheese moon!\n\nFortunately, the junkyard has everything the rats need to build their rocket, and the other animals are willing to support this daring venture \u0026mdash; at least if they\u0027re well paid. Of course, all the rats work together to achieve this mighty goal. However, each rat family competes to build the most rocket parts and to train the most rattronauts so they can feast on as much of the lunar cheese as possible.\n\nIn First Rat, each player starts with two rats and may raise two more. On your turn, you either move one of your rats 1-5 spaces on the path or move 2-4 of your rats 1-3 spaces each as long as they end up on spaces of the same color. Your rats can never share the same space, and if you land in a space with another player\u0027s rat, you must pay them one cheese, borrowing cheese from the back as needed. After movement, you collect resources (cheese, tin cans, apple cores, baking soda, etc.) matching the color of the space you occupy or move your lightbulb along the light string, which will boost your income in future turns. (More lights in the junkyard makes it easier for you to find things!)\n\nIf you end movement near a store, you can spend resources to buy a backpack or bottle top \u0026mdash; or you can steal an item instead, with the rat then returning to the start of the movement track. You can also spend resources to build rocket sections (and score points) or spend cheese in bulk as a donation (and score points).\n\nWhen you pick up apple cores, you move around the rat burrow to pick up comics or stored food or raise one of your rats from the nursery. Alternatively, you automatically get a new rat when one of your rats reaches the launch pad and boards the spaceship. When a player places their fourth rat on the spaceship \u0026mdash; or places their eighth scoring marker on the board \u0026mdash; the game ends, and the player with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, the tied player with the most rattronauts in the rocket wins.\n\nFirst Rat includes a solo mode as well as variable game set-ups described in the rulebook.\n\n",

    "description": "In Roads \u0026 Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone. With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.\n\nIn more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they\u0027re produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.\n\nThird edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.\nFor its 20th Anniversary, Roads \u0026 Boats has an edition that contains the \u0026cetera expansion: Roads \u0026 Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition\n\n",

Each turn goes as follows:\n\n1. Action Phase: Perform three actions, such as play new cards, get new cards from the market, speculate on cards in the market, buy land, or redeploy troops.\n2. Discard Headlines: Remove any Headlines (i.e. cards with the Bull-Bear icon) that have reached the leftmost position in the Market.\n3. Restore Market: Restore the Market to twelve cards.\n4. Income Phase: Collect one gold per Income, Extortion, and Connection Cube in play. If Depression, pay one gold for each card in play (includes Partners and Enterprises in your Row, and all of your Troops).\n\nFour \u0022scoring\u0022 cards (Toppling) are in the game and their effect depends on the current form of government. The government can change if troops are played and as a result of other cards. The form of government also influences different production values of the game, such as how much mines produce. Players win by toppling D\u0026iacute;az, either by coup, succession, revolution, or annexation of Mexico by the U.S. If D\u0026iacute;az remains firmly seated at the end of the game, then the player with the most gold wins.\n\nPax Porfiriana includes 220 cards, but only fifty cards (along with ten for each player) are used in a game, so no two games will be the same!\n\n",

Join forces to fend off Viking invaders, build monasteries to extend your influence, and gather support in towns and villages throughout the land. To become High King of all Ireland, you need to navigate a web of shifting alliances, outmaneuver your enemies, and grab history by the reins.\n\nThe success of the historical Brian Boru rested on three pillars: his victories against the Vikings, the favor he managed to garner with the Church, and the alliances he forged through political marriages. This became the foundation of the game, with each pillar becoming a suit in the trick-taking that forms the core of the mechanisms. Win a trick and you gain influence in a town, which, in turn, gains you majorities in the regions; if you lose the trick, however (deliberately or otherwise), you instead take an action corresponding to the suit of the card.\n\n",

They try to settle the big island and each player tries to explore one part of it by placing landscape tiles. Landscape tiles grant resources and those are used to erect buildings with special abilities. Barriers on the island have to be removed in order to explore the island even further. Players build valuable statues and supply ships get them the supplies from the old world they need to be a successful settler on Cooper Island.\n\nThe special thing about Cooper Island is the way the players mark their victory points. They sail with ships around the island to show their progress. On their way around the island they find smaller islands inshore that grant valuable benefits. After five rounds, a game of Cooper Island ends and the player who developed the best and went on furthest with their ships will win.\n\n\u0026bull;\u0026bull;\u0026bull;\n\nThe second printing of the German and English versions of the game, along with the Spanish version of the game, include the Solo Against Cooper expansion that was originally available separately as a bonus item.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "One-hundred years ago, The Infinity Engine was shattered and its reality-bending shards have destroyed most of the world. Now, it falls upon you to gather your forces, defeat your adversaries, and rebuild the Infinity Engine! Will you survive?\n\nShards of Infinity combines an unprecedented level of strategy and customization into one small box. Rather than competing for points, players must outlast their opponents and reduce their health to zero, which can be done in a number of ways. Each player starts the game with a basic deck of cards, and they can acquire new cards from a central display of six cards (as in Ascension) and add these new cards to their deck or use them immediately, depending on what they are.\n\nEvery character starts with fifty health and zero mastery. On each turn, you can spend one gem (a.k.a., money) to gain a mastery point. The more mastery you have, the more powerful your cards become. This lets even the weak cards in your starting deck become more powerful as the game progresses. If you reach a total of thirty mastery, you can activate your Infinity Shard, which instantly defeats your opponent.\n\nAs you acquire new cards, you can employ allies and champions to craft your strategy. Mercenary cards can be added to your deck as in other deck-building games or they can be played immediately from the center row for their ability; this adds even more drama to each player\u0027s turn as a key mercenary flip can alter the very outcome of the game!\n\n",

    "name": "Cuba Libre",
    "year": 2013,
    "description": "In December 1956, paroled rebel Fidel Castro returned to Cuba to launch his revolution with virtually no political base and\u0026mdash;after a disastrous initial encounter with government forces\u0026mdash;a total of just 12 men.  Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra\u0026uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans\u0026rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald\u0026iacute;var.  Castro\u0026rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.\n\nCastro\u0026rsquo;s Insurgency\n\nFollowing up on GMT Games\u0026rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;26 July Movement\u0026rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista\u0026rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.\n\nCOIN Series, Volume II\n\nCuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players\u0026mdash;both volumes share the same innovative Series: COIN (GMT) system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4\u0026mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre\u0026rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes \u0026hellip;\n\n\u0026bull; The Twelve:  The first wave\u0026rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra\u0026mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?\n\u0026bull; El Che and Ra\u0026uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?\n\u0026bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?\n\u0026bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?\n\u0026bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?\n\u0026bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?\n\u0026bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?\n\u0026bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics\u0026mdash;will they help or hurt?\n\u0026bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob\u0026rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?\n\u0026bull; Sinatra:  Frankie\u0026rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?\n\u0026hellip; and much more.\n\nNew twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:\n\n\u0026bull; It\u0026rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.\n\u0026bull; The Syndicate\u0026rsquo;s bases are Casinos\u0026mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  \n\u0026bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the \u0026ldquo;muscle\u0026rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  \n\u0026bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone\u0026rsquo;s hands\u0026mdash;even the corrupt Government\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026bull; The Government has its own terror tactic\u0026mdash;reprisals\u0026mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.\n\u0026bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.\n\u0026bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end\u0026mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!\n\nMultiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire\n\nCuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.\n\nMore COIN Series Volumes to Come\n\nAndean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series). A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons, as modern insurgency offers virtually unlimited, under-gamed topics for the COIN Series.  Volume III is A Distant Plain\u2014Insurgency in Afghanistan.  Volume IV is Fire in the Lake\u2014Insurgency in Vietnam.\n\n",

    "description": "Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.\n\nWhat are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and \u002B2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you\u0027re collecting.\n\nOnce only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is \u0026plusmn;1 point, the second card is \u0026plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!\n\nA two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.\n\nNordic version include extensions: \u0027Coloretto: The Extra Cards\u0027, \u0027Coloretto: The Limit Cards\u0027 and \u0027Coloretto for two players\u0027.\n\n",

    "name": "Three Sisters",
    "year": 2022,
    "description": "Three Sisters is a strategic roll-and-write game about backyard farming. Three Sisters is named after an indigenous agricultural technique still widely used today in which three different crops \u0026mdash; pumpkins, corn, and beans \u0026mdash; are planted close together. Corn provides a lattice for beans to climb, the beans bring nitrogen from the air into the soil, and the squash provides a natural mulch ground cover to reduce weeds and keep pests away.\n\nIn the game, you have your own player sheet with multiple areas: the garden, which is divided into six numbered zones, each containing the three crop types; the apiary; compost; perennials; goods; fruit; and the shed, which is filled with tools that have special abilities. All the crops, fruits, flowers, and hives are represented by tracks that you will mark off as you acquire these items. Many of the tracks are interconnected with other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way. A common feature of these tracks are circles that represent a harvest, which generates goods; get enough goods, and you unlock bonus actions. Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses.\n\nThe game lasts eight rounds. Each round, roll dice based on the number of players, group them by number, then place them on an action space of the circular action wheel, starting with the current position of the farmer; the farmer moves each round, which means that dice showing 1s, 2s, etc. will end up on different spaces each round. Once the dice have been placed, each player drafts one die and uses it as described below. Once everyone has drafted a die, all players get to use the lowest-valued die remaining on the action wheel. A die lets you do two things, which you can do in either order:\n\n\n     Plant or water the numbered zone matching the value of the die.\n     Take the action of the space from which you removed the die.\n\n\nTo plant, you mark the bottom space of two empty crop tracks. (Note that you can\u0027t plant beans until the corn adjacent to the beans is tall enough to support them.) To water, you mark one space in all the crop tracks that already have at least one mark in them. As for the actions on the action wheel, you can:\n\n\n     Plant or water again in the same numbered zone.\n     Gain one compost (which lets you adjust die values) and four goods (which will get you bonuses at the farmer\u0027s market).\n     Mark off the hive track, which can bring you points, goods, or bonus actions.\n     Mark one of the four fruit tracks. Each fruit is worth different points and different amounts of goods and has different track lengths and circle positions.\n     Visit the farmer\u0027s market, which gives you points and bonuses based on the number of goods you\u0027ve collected.\n     Mark one of the fifteen tool tracks in your shed. As soon as you complete a track, you gain that power or end-game scoring opportunity.\n\n\nPerennials don\u0027t have a direct action associated with them and are marked off only through actions in other areas, with the various perennials giving different bonuses as you mark them.\n\nAt the end of the round, all players receive a bonus action, either rain that waters all numbered zones in your garden, a trip to the shed, or a visit to the farmer\u0027s market. After eight rounds, you score points for harvested crops, perennials, the apiary, fruit, and some shed items. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\nThree Sisters has a solo mode in which you try to top your own score against an \u0022opponent\u0022 that drafts dice and blocks areas of your sheet.\n\n",

    "description": "Beer \u0026 Bread is a multi-use card game for two players. Its clever structure of alternating rounds puts a fascinating twist on player interaction, card drafting, and resource management.\n\nFounded on the fruitful lands of an erstwhile monastery, two villages have held up the dual tradition of brewing beer and baking bread. While sharing fields and resources, they still find pride in their friendly rivalry of besting each other\u0026rsquo;s produce.\n\nEach of you represents one of these villages. Over the course of six years - which alternate between fruitful and dry - you must harmonize your duties of harvesting and storing resources, producing beer and bread, selling them for coins and upgrading your facilities.\n\nHowever, in order to win, you must maintain the balance between your baked and liquid goods. Because, after the sixth year, you only score the coins collected from the type of good - beer or bread - for which you earned less. The village with the higher score wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "year": 2021,
    "description": "Golem is an engine-building game by Simone Luciani, Virginio Gigli and Flaminia Brasini, the same team that brought you Grand Austria Hotel and Lorenzo il Magnifico.\n\nThe game is based on the 16th-century legend of the Golem of Prague, an anthropomorphic creature that Rabbi Loew animated from a clay statue to protect his people. In the game, players take on the role of rabbis who create and grow these powerful creatures that will be moved around the neighborhoods of Prague under the control of students. Be careful, because if a golem becomes too powerful, it will destroy everything it encounters on its way. Players can also kill their Golems in order to get bonuses.\n\nPlayers also create powerful artifacts and acquire knowledge by collecting ancient books.\n\nThe game is divided into four rounds, and each round is composed of 7 phases:\n\n\n     Refresh\n     Golem Movement\n     Actions (2 marble actions and 1 rabbi action)\n     Turn Order\n     Influence Character\n     Income and Development\n     Golem Control\n\n\nAt the beginning of each round, the players will shuffle the colored marbles into the 3D synagogue that will split them into five lines corresponding to the five main actions available in the game:\n\n\n     Work: By paying Knowledge, you can activate the Golem placed in the city of Prague and get bonuses.\n     Golem: Obtain clay to create new golems and upgrade the developments on your personal board.\n     Artifact: Obtain coins and buy gold to build artifacts that offer permanent bonuses in the game and upgrade developments on your personal board.\n     Spells: Obtain Knowledge and perform spells (with a scoring for book collection) and upgrade developments on your personal board.\n     Mirror: Perform one action of your choice by paying 1 coin.\n\n\nThe number of marbles available in the corresponding action line determines how much the player gets from the action. When you choose an action, you collect one marble of your choice in the corresponding line and depending on the color of the marble you chose, you also move your student forward on one of the districts of Prague.\n\nIt\u0027s important to advance your students on those tracks to be able to keep your golems under control. At the end of the round, knowledge can also be used to control a golem that surpassed its students, but if one of these creatures is uncontrolled, it may become dangerous and destroy the neighborhood, after which you will have to destroy and bury it!\n\nThe marble color also matters, because at the end of the round, if you get the correct combination of two colors, you receive the favor of one of the powerful Prague characters, which will differ each round.\n\nAt the end of the fourth round, players score points for active or buried golems, artifacts, books, development on their personal board, and collected goal cards.\n\n",

The rules are similar to 1830: Railways \u0026 Robber Barons on a smaller and terrain-heavy map.\n\nIn 1889, 2-6 players will use money to purchase shares in railroad companies during Share Dealing Rounds. Between subsequent Share Dealing Rounds, railroad corporations then conduct operations on the game board, with the decisions being made by the player who is the major share holder. The game simulates the progression of railroad development during an historic period on Shikoku. Old trains become obsolete while the revenue earnings from cities grows over time. Players will try to purchase the most profitable shares at the right times of the game to maximize earnings in dividends and stock value gains. In the end, the player with the highest value of personal cash and held stocks is the winner.\n\nThe game was originally available in kit form from Wild Heaven, and is now also being published by Grand Trunk Games.\n\n",

Players can fund distributors across the country, but if they don\u0026rsquo;t supply distributors with vehicles to sell, they go bankrupt, taking your investment with them.  Alternatively, players can drop the prices on their cars to move their market share, or even temporarily improve sales rates at the cost of research. Special action spaces are available that give a player a one-turn special ability with the actions provided by Ford, Durant, Kettering, and others somewhat related to their actual business history.\n\nAs newer models make their way onto the market, they sell at the expense of the older models.  Older factories give inefficiency cubes as time passes, encouraging you to keep pace with technology.\n\nTo get money, you need to build cars with your factories, but if you build more than there is demand they lose not only the money spent to make them, but gain inefficiency cubes that hurt them for the rest of the game. Whoever manages their car factories the best over this 120-150 minute game will win.\n\n",

    "description": "Struggle of Empires recreates the various wars fought between the European powers as they attempted to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century.  Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.\n\nFrom the designer:\nThink of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he\u0027s allied, he\u0027s with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn\u0027t really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.\n\n",

Later in the round, players score points based on how they\u0027ve placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player\u0027s score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nAzul: Master Chocolatier includes double-sided factory boards, with these tiles being placed on these boards at the start of each round. One side of the factories is blank, and when using this side the game plays exactly like Azul. The other side of each factory tile has a special effect on it that modifies play in one way or another, putting a twist on the normal game. Additionally, the tiles are modeled to look like chocolates and other treats, despite remaining as inedible as the tiles in the original game.\n\n",

As the bullets and bombs tear the city asunder, only through wits and valor can you seize the cornerstone of the entire Eastern Front and change the course of history.\n\nA heavy burden rests on your shoulders. Every casualty suffered in battle will weaken your forces for the entire campaign. Every bomb blast and mortar shell leaves the very ground for which you are fighting in further ruin. Every inch lost to the enemy brings you closer to the jaws of defeat. Over the course of up to fifteen branching scenarios, you will decide the fate of Stalingrad and, perhaps, the war itself. Even though the consequences of your actions will persist, the game itself can be fully reset and replayed, allowing you to explore every potential outcome.\n\nUndaunted: Stalingrad is a monumental, platoon-level, standalone campaign game with branching narratives that expands the series\u0027 scope and challenge beyond anything that\u0027s come before.

    "description": "This sequel to the Zombicide: Black Plague will bring players back into a world of deadly medieval fantasy, this time filled with infected orcs and goblins who will put survivors to the ultimate test. This green menace is not only stronger than their human counterparts, but they also tend to gather into massive hordes that ambush the survivors when they least expect it.\n\nSet in the same medieval era as Black Plague, players will take on the role of Survivors looking to defeat the shuffling, undead menace by any means possible.\n\nIn Green Horde, up to six players can join the battle for survival. They\u0026rsquo;ll combine forces and work cooperatively to accomplish their goals, and against all odds, stay alive. Fans of the Zombicide series have become familiar with the Walkers, Runners, Fatties, and Abominations that shuffle around, looking for victims. But the creatures they will face are not just zombie humans, they\u0026rsquo;re zombie orcs! The Survivors will have to gear up with a wide variety of medieval equipment if they hope to outlast these fearsome foes. Zombie Orcs are stronger than the classic zombie and represent a stiffer challenge to even seasoned undead-hunting veterans.\n\nA new challenge for the Survivors is the Horde. It represents a growing group of Orc zombies that are ready to enter the board in an unexpected location and ambush the Survivors. As zombie cards with the Horde symbol are drawn, one extra zombie miniature of the same type is set aside, collectively forming the Horde. They will be locked into place until an \u0026ldquo;Enter the Horde!\u0026rdquo; card is drawn, spawning the Horde on the board. Any Survivor caught on their own near this roving menace would best beat a hasty retreat.\n\nWith such menacing new foes, the Survivors are going to have their hands full dealing with the Green Horde. Luckily, they\u0026rsquo;ll have some new weapons and spells on their side to help combat the rotting masses. Things like the Lava Burst, the Norse Sword, and the Bone Kukri will all be helpful when hacking through a pack of the undead. Oh, and if they should gather together too tightly, the Survivors can always hit them with the catapult...(did we not mention the catapult?).\n\nZombicide: Green Horde includes ten new challenging quests, featuring some of the toughest scenarios a Survivor has ever had to face. With new terrain, like ledges and water holes, and the ever-present threat of the Green Horde making an appearance, the team will have to plan their routes carefully. Sometimes avoiding trouble is better than facing it head on! Zombicide: Green Horde is the next chapter in the ever-evolving world of Zombicide. There\u0026rsquo;s no rest for the Survivors if they hope to battle their way to a new hope and a new beginning.\n\n",

On your turn, you will perform one of eight actions and acquire pillars of civilization.\n\nAcquiring pillars is important in creating the unique mosaic of your civilization. They are used as prerequisites for many new technologies, as well as for scoring. Also, by pursuing specialization in one or more civilization pillars, you may be able to claim a \u0026lsquo;Golden Age\u0026rsquo; of that type.\n\nAs the game goes on and your civilization grows, scoring cards are eventually revealed from the four decks. Each time a scoring card is revealed, your civilization will score for each region that you dominate with your cities, towns, wonders, and military units. After the third scoring card is revealed, there is one final turn and the game ends. You will then score for your cities and towns, your wonders, projects, achievements, and golden ages, and for all of your cards that score for your unique civilization pillars.\n\n-description from publisher (corrected and updated)\n\nPlease note that the solo rules are only included in the Kickstarter editions, not in the retail versions (although they are available as print-and-play in French at the very least).\n\nSadly, the editor wasn\u0027t able to deliver what the backers paid for.\n\n",

    "description": "The period of the Warring States (475-221 BCE) describes a time of endless wars between seven rival states: Qin, Chu, Qi, Yan, Han, Wei, and Zhao. These states were finally unified in 221 BCE\u0026nbsp;under the Qin dynasty to lay the origin of today\u0027s China, with its two main rivers: the Yellow and the Yangtze.\n\nYellow \u0026 Yangtze, the sister game to the highly acclaimed board game Tigris \u0026 Euphrates, invites you to replay this eventful period and to lead your dynasty to victory.\n\nIn Yellow \u0026 Yangtze, players build civilizations through tile placement. Players are given five different leaders: Governor, Soldier, Farmer, Trader, and Artisan. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category. Conflicts arise when civilizations connect on the board. To succeed, players\u0027 civilizations must survive these conflicts, calm peasant revolts, and grow secure enough to build prestigious pagodas.\n\n",

    "description": "Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition\u0027s handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.\n\nThe key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in \u0022time\u0022. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the \u0022time\u0022 to catch up.\n\nIn addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.\n\nThis is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Jenseits von Theben\n\n\n",

    "description": "Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.\n\nIn the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player\u0027s hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.\n\nNext, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.\n\nThe origin date listed for this game is approximate.\n\n",

But you are not alone in your mission as the animal guardians have come together to lend a hand around the Circle of Spirits where you progress. Each turn, they bring you valuable elements, so try to combine your team of animal guardians as best as possible to carry out your actions, but be careful: some of them are solitary and do not like to be mixed with others...\n\nYou have one of three ways to achieve your goal: by planting 12 different Protective Trees, by collecting 12 Sacred Flowers to awaken Sanki the great Guardian of the Forest, by extinguishing 12 Fires to permanently repel Onibi.\n\nEach turn includes 3 phases: \n\u0026bull; Guardian Animals (simultaneous push your luck phase) : You draw and turn face up, one after the other, the Guardian Animal cards from your personal stack. You thus form the Animal Guardian Help Line. You can stop drawing cards whenever you want. However, if you reveal a card showing a third solitary symbol, then you must stop drawing cards. This card closes your Help Line.\n\u0026bull; Action phase: You play in turn. If your Help Line shows strictly less than three solitary symbols (not canceled by gregarious symbols), you can then perform 2 different Actions. If your Help Line shows three solitary symbols (not canceled by gregarious symbols), you can then perform only 1 Action. The strength of an Action is determined by the number of corresponding Elements visible on the Guardian Animal cards in your Help Line and on your Forest individual board.\n\u0026bull; End of the turn:\n- Onibi attacks you: If some Fires remain at the center of the Circle of Spirits and you cannot resist them, then add as many Fire Varan cards to your discard stack as there are Fire tiles at the center of the Circle of Spirits.\n- Onibi attacks the Sacred Tree: Add as many Fires to the center of the Circle of Spirits as there are Guardian Animal cards taken this turn.\n- The arrival of new Guardian Animals: Complete the Guardian Animal reserve by revealing as many new cards per level as there were cards taken this turn.\n- Passing the Sacred Tree: Give the Sacred Tree to the next Spirit of Nature clockwise.\n- The Return of Guardian Animals: Move all the Animal Guardian cards from your Help Line to your personal discard stack.\n\nThe game stops at the end of a complete turn when one of the Spirits of Nature has managed to collect at least 12 different Protective Trees OR 12 Fires OR 12 Sacred Flowers.\n\n",

    "description": "Conan, based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players  play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard\u0027s novels and short stories.\n\nEach game is a scenario, played on a map. There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It\u0027s possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There are 9 scenarios in the base box.\n\nAt the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives.\n\nDuring their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend \u0022gems\u0022 from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their \u0022spent\u0022 pool box to their \u0022available\u0022 pool box.  The Overlord plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement.\n\nIn a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective \u0026mdash; but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.\n\n",

    "name": "Formula D",
    "year": 2008,
    "description": "Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D\u00E9 with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -\n\nThe game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a \u0022stop\u0022 rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. \n Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car\u0026rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car\u0026rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.\n\nHowever, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.\n\nFormula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a \u0022Dashboard\u0022 with movable pegs to manage your car\u0026rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with \u0022Character\u0022 profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of \u0022Fuel\u0022 for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.\n\nThe popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D\u00E9 Mini), and a lot of \u0022after market\u0022 parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.\n\n",

    "description": "The year is AD 79. Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?\n\nThe simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required \u0026ndash; along with a little luck \u0026ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.\n\nThe game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent\u0027s piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.\n\nAfter the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.\n\n\u0026bull;\u0026bull;\u0026bull;\n\nThe 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new \u0022Dual Vent\u0022 variant.\n\n",

    "description": "Send out the scouts! Position the Flagship in tactical orbit! And reconfigure that Battlestation into something new! Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.\n\nIn Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.\n\nEach type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You\u0027re not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.\n\nYou win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.\n\nWith elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.\n\nQuantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.\n\n",

At the end of the game the player with the most food, traits, and population wins.\n\nEvolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.  The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.  And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.  So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.\n\n",

The Locust horde arrived without warning, and countless horrors spilled forth from their underground burrows. The Coalition of Organized Governments (COG) struggled to fend off the subterranean threat, but their defenses were quickly crushed. With billions dead, humans turned their weapons of mass destruction on their own cities to deny the enemy control. Now the long struggle against overwhelming odds approaches one final, desperate stand.\n\nGears of War: The Board Game, designed by Corey Konieczka, is based on the wildly popular third-person shooter by Epic Games. One to four players take on the roles of COG soldiers cooperating to destroy the Locust horde, and must work together to complete missions against an ingeniously challenging and varied game system. In Gears of War: The Board Game, you\u0026rsquo;ll relive classic moments from Gears of War and Gears of War 2 \u0026ndash; Roadie Run into cover, spray your enemy with blind fire, or rip him in half with your Lancer\u0027s chainsaw!\n\nIn Gears of War: The Board Game you must fulfill one of seven randomly constructed missions and support your fellow COGs as your team engages an unflinching enemy in furious, white-knuckle firefights! Only through teamwork and communication will you gain a tactical advantage, completing your mission and striking a blow for humanity.\n\nYou\u0027ll need every soldier you can get if you hope to send the Locust horde back to their holes. Leave no man behind!\n\nERRATA\n- In the Roadblocks mission level 3, use tile 12A instead of 3A.\n- In the rules, under Component List, the following three entries are incorrect:\n-- 23 Wound/Dropped Weapon Markers, should be 22\n-- 12 Grenade Tokens, should be 14\n-- 36 Ammo Tokens, should be 44\n\n",

    "description": "Between Two Castles of Mad King Ludwig is published by Stonemaier Games as part of a collaboration with Bezier Games.\n\nThe king demands a castle! You are a world-renowned master builder who has been asked by the Mad King Ludwig to help design his castles. Projects of such significance require the expertise of more than one person, so for each assignment you are paired with another master builder to execute your grandiose plans. Will your planning and collaborative skills be enough to design the most impressive castles in the world?\n\nBetween Two Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a competitive tile-drafting game in which each tile is a room in a castle. You work together with the player on your left to design one castle, and with the player on your right on another castle. On each turn you select two tiles from your hand, reveal them, then work with your partners to place them. To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion between two castles.\n\nThis game includes 147 regular room tiles with unique art, 83 other tiles, 20 bonus cards, 7 custom wooden castle tokens, 1 full-color, double-sided scorepad, and a 4-piece Game Trayz custom insert that reduces setup time to less than 60 seconds.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "year": 2021,
    "description": "Sixty-Something Millions of Years Ago \u0026mdash; A great ice age has ended. With massive warming altering the globe, another titanic struggle for supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species.\n\nDominant Species: Marine is a game that abstractly recreates a small portion of ancient history: the ending of an onerous ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.\n\nEach player will assume the role of one of four major aquatic-based animal classes \u0026mdash; reptiles, fish, cephalopod or crustacean. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won\u0026rsquo;t last: It is indeed \u0026ldquo;survival of the fittest.\u0026rdquo;\n\nThrough wily action pawn placement, you will attempt to thrive in as many different habitats as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. You will also want to propagate your individual species in order to earn victory points for your animal. You will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration and adaptation actions, among others.\n\nAll of this eventually leads to the end game \u0026ndash; the final ascent of a vast tropical ocean and its shorelines \u0026ndash; where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have their animal crowned the Dominant Species.\n\nBut somebody better become dominant quickly, because there\u0026rsquo;s a large asteroid heading this way....\n\nGame Play\n\nThe large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of the main ocean on earth as it might have appeared tens of millions of years ago. The smaller Hydrothermal Vent tiles will be placed atop some of the larger tiles throughout play, converting them into Vents in the process.\n\nThe action pawns drive the game. Each pawn allows a player to perform the various actions that can be taken\u0026mdash;such as speciation, environmental change, migration or evolution. When placed on the action display, a pawn will immediately trigger that particular action for its owning player. Dominant Species: Marine includes new \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; pawns that can be acquired during the course of play. These special pawns have enhanced placement capabilities over the \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; pawns that each player begins the game with.\n\nGenerally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal\u0026rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities, ongoing benefits, or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.\n\nThroughout the game species cubes will be added to, moved about on, and removed from the tiles in play (\u0026ldquo;earth\u0026rdquo;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth.\n\nWhen the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile and score their controlled special pawns\u0026mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.\n\nDominant Species Veterans\n\nFor players of the original Dominant Species, this iteration introduces several key evolutions to the system (pun definitely intended): \n\n     Actions are taken immediately whenever a pawn is placed instead of waiting to execute actions after all pawns are on the board. This gives players a bit more flexibility in their strategy, doesn\u0026rsquo;t increase game time when more pawns are acquired by players, and lessens the brain-burn quite a bit since it alleviates the burden of having to plan out an entire turn in advance. \n     Domination is no longer on a per-tile basis, and is no longer \u0026lsquo;competitive\u0026rsquo; with other players. In this game you check dominance for each element type over the entire earth, and whether or not you dominate an element type is independent of whether one or more opponents also dominate it. Domination of an element is how you acquire \u0026ndash; and try to maintain \u0026ndash; control of the special pawns.\n     Animals no longer have default special abilities. Now, players are dealt 3 Trait cards during setup, choosing one to keep and putting the others back in the box. The chosen Trait gives their animal one of eighteen unique abilities spread amongst the Trait cards. \n     Acquiring special pawns through domination gives a player great flexibility in planning and executing a strategy. Special pawns can \u0026lsquo;bump\u0026rsquo; an opponent\u0026rsquo;s basic pawn in order to take an action that would otherwise be blocked. They can be placed anywhere on the action display (where basic pawns must be placed in top-to-bottom order only). There are powerful action spaces where only a special pawn can be placed. And at the end of the game, each special pawn awards its owner VPs according to its highest achieved dominance value.\n\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

As a Hunter, it falls to you to quell this growing threat. You will have to fight through beasts, monsters, and townsfolk alike to survive the night and discover the source of this madness.\n\nIn the campaign-based action-adventure Bloodborne: The Board Game, players take on the role of Hunters, working together against the game to uncover the mysteries hidden within the city of Yharnam and beyond. Featuring unique Trick Weapons, each with various forms and powers, Hunters have to think quickly and adapt their tactics to overcome the multitude of foes that stand in their way. Learn their behavior, exploit their weaknesses, and strike them down! Featuring unique card-driven combat, luck has little place here \u0026mdash; success or failure depends on your choices and how you approach each engagement!\n\nOf course, against such horrific foes, death is a common occurrence, but worry not as death is no end for a Hunter. Those who fall in combat awaken in the Hunter\u0027s Dream, ready to return fresh to the fight. Be warned, however, that upon awakening you might find previous foes and obstacles returned, Worse, time is not on your side as the Blood Moon rises ever higher into the sky, spreading its madness across Yharnam. You must press ever forward if you and your comrades hope to complete the Hunt before the city meets an unfortunate end.\n\nAs you set out onto the Hunt, always remember the old adage:\n\n\u0022We are born of the blood, made men by the blood, undone by the blood.

    "description": "In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1\u002B4 and 5\u002B6 for 5 \u0026 11, 1\u002B5 and 4\u002B6 for 6 \u0026 10, or 1\u002B6 and 4\u002B5 for 7 \u0026 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn\u0026rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn\u0026rsquo;s progress lost.\n\nA predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.\n\n",

    "description": "Time\u0027s Up! is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player\u0027s cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game\u0027s three rounds.\n\nIn each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they\u0027ll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time\u0027s up!\n\nTime\u0027s Up! is based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.  Also known as Salad Bowl or Fish Bowl.\n\n",

    "description": "In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.\n\nEach turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.\nNext, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.\n\nThe game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who\u0027s placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player\u0027s turn.\n\nA lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent\u0027s growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...\n\n",

As the chief of your tribe, you must lead your people to prosperity through the cultivation and trade of cacao \u0026mdash; and to do that, you\u0027ll need to put them to work in the best way possible.\n\nIn the game, each player has an individual deck of square worker tiles, with the number of workers on each side of the tile varying from tile to tile. The playing area starts with only a couple of jungle tiles in play: a cacao field and a small market; two jungle tiles are laid face up, and the remaining jungle tiles stacked as a draw pile.\n\nOn a player\u0027s turn, he places one of her worker tiles on the board adjacent to one or more jungle tiles already in play, then (if two worker tiles are next to an empty space) adds one of the jungle tiles to the playing area in this space. Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they\u0027re next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on. He then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles.\n\nOnce all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends. Players score (or lose) points based on their water supply, and each temple rewards whichever players sent the most workers to it. In the end, whoever has collected the most gold wins.\n\n",

During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player\u0026rsquo;s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.\n\nBy building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.\n\nEach game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards (3 of 10), special actions (4 of 8), and terrain sectors to build the map (4 of 8), ensuring you won\u0027t play the same game twice!\n\nKingdom Builder FAQ - please read before posting questions in the forum.\n\n",

Can Robin Hood and his companions escape the sheriff\u0027s guards and complete their adventures successfully?\n\nIn The Adventures of Robin Hood, players take on the role of Robin Hood and his companions, with the action taking place on a living game board with no set paths. The board changes over the course of each adventure, and the movement of the characters is handled via an innovative mechanism that uses different length wooden character pieces. Various actions and secrets are integrated into the game levels and are revealed only in the course of the story. The game board \u0022remembers\u0022 what players have already explored or found, and thanks to the special materials, the entire game can be set up and dismantled quickly.\n\nInstead of using cards as in the author\u0027s Legends of Andor, the game tells the story of Robin Hood in a high-quality hardcover book, and depending on the decisions the players make, the story changes...\n\n",

In the end, one nation will rise above all others to leave its indelible mark upon history.\n\nThis new game presents players with an undiscovered country to conquer, built from beautifully illustrated map tiles. These would-be conquerors construct and populate the map with barbarians, natural resources, and city-states, then formulate their plans for how they will shape this world to their vision. Their exact goals, however, change with each game. Agendas are detailed on victory cards, three of which are drawn during set up.

    "year": 2015,
    "description": "In A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, the warring factions of Westeros await your command, inviting you to engage in a life-or-death struggle. In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.\n\nYour ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow\u0027s Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!\n\nIn the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow\u0027s Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.\n\nAt the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.\n\nA Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game\u0027s origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.\n\nThe timing rules \u0026mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses \u0026mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG\u0027s newer LCGs.\n\nThe second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.\n\n",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nAfter being stripped of all their possessions, a mage, a warrior, an elf, and a dwarf are forced to go rob the local Magic Maze shopping mall for all the equipment necessary for their next adventure. They agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first, then find each individual\u0026rsquo;s favorite store, and then locate the exit. In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit. That\u0027s the plan anyway\u0026hellip;but can they pull it off?\n\nMagic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator\u0026hellip; All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.\n\nAt the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!\n\n",

    "description": "Trails of Tucana is a flip-and-write game from the creators of Avenue and Doodle City that is quick and easy to play, but has enough depth to entertain gamers.\n\nEach player is given a map of the island Tucana, showing its villages and important sights. The positions of the villages are randomized for each player, so every game will provide a unique puzzle.\n\nEach turn, one player flips over two terrain cards. Each player must draw \u0026mdash; on their own map \u0026mdash; a trail between two neighboring spaces of the shown terrains. Gradually, the trails will grow into a network of roads. Players score points by connecting matching harbors, and by connecting sights to harbors. Being the first to connect a pair of harbors provides bonus points.\n\nTo add depth to the game, there are varying distribution of the different terrain cards. Mountain cards are for instance rarer than desert cards, so it would be harder to build a trail through a mountain range or over water than through desert or forest. Players need to take this into account when planning their routes. And they should maximize the probability that they will be able to make use of any combination of terrain cards that may come up.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from designer\n\nAWARDS AND HONORS:\n\n2021 Finnish Game of the Year (family) WINNER\n2020 Norwegian Game of the Year WINNER\n2020 Norwegian Game of the Year NOMINEE\n2019 The Dice Tower SEAL OF EXCELLENCE\n\n",

Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.\n\nElder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.\n\nTo locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.\n\n",

Each invention is a veritable evolutionary step. Humans\u0027 use of tools surpasses the efforts of all others, making Homo sapiens technologists since before historical records were invented.\n\nInventions: Evolution of Ideas follows humanity\u0027s most noteworthy innovations and places the power of these technological developments in your hands to evolve your societies over the ages.\n\nIn Inventions, cards simulate these new concepts. Cards are the ideas that eventually become inventions. Once they are invented, these technologies can be shared with the world, and everyone involved in the process spreads the exciting news, giving credit where credit is due. Developing these inventions progresses your society, advancing its technology, economy, and culture. You can even share with other societies, boosting the inventions\u0027 efficacy even more!\n\nInventions is a tactical game, but you will do best by building these tactics around a long-term strategy. Each society\u0027s progress will be measured in Intellectual Property Points (IPP), and the player who has the most IPP has the strongest society and wins the game.\n\n",

Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.\n\nOn a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.\n\nOne of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player\u0027s fate deck, then play one of them on that player\u0027s board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player\u0027s locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain\u0027s movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.\n\nVillainous: Wicked to the Core is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the Villainous base game from 2018.\n\n",

Since you were a child, you had strange, prophetic dreams in which you saw violent scenes of past crimes or even ones yet to be committed. Over time you learned that your unusual gift could be put to good use and you started to solve cases that nobody else could crack. This earned you some reputation in the city and now people seek your help whenever a mysterious crime is committed.\u0022\n\nThe Chronicles of Crime: 1400 standalone game brings back well-known mechanisms of the original Chronicles of Crime game while adding some new twists. Now you can deduce not only from the evidence you find or the testimonies given by various characters but also from the mysterious scenes depicted on new Vision Cards. These scenes can be either from the future or from the past and they usually involve characters and objects yet to be revealed.\n\nDuring your investigation, you can also count on your family members to share their knowledge with you. You can ask your uncle, a monk who has a wealth of knowledge about written texts, your sister a merchant who knows something about almost any object you\u0026rsquo;ll find or even your brother, a king\u0026rsquo;s spy, who knows a story or two about many of the people you will meet. Finally, your faithful dog is always willing to trace a suspect for you, just bring him an item belonging to the person in question and he\u0026rsquo;ll track them down!\n\nPart of Chronicles of Crime - The Millennium Series\nChronicles of Crime is back with a range of games called \u0022The Millennium Series\u0022. Three brand new standalone Chronicles of Crime games, working with the same great system but providing interesting gameplay twists and refreshing universes that span an entire millennium from 1400 to 1900 and finally 2400.

In the ensuing Dark Years, the factions of the galaxy retreated and recovered their strength. Now, they look upon the stars and see an opportunity\u0026mdash;a chance to reclaim what was lost. A chance to redefine galactic civilization. A chance to leave their mark upon the stars.\n\nTwilight Inscription, an epic roll-and-write game for one to eight players, offers an experience unlike anything Fantasy Flight Games has done before. With a limited pool of resources at your disposal, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to carefully manage Navigation, Expansion, Industry, and Warfare as you amass victory points and earn your right to the throne on Mecatol Rex. Will your faction become the new rulers of the galaxy? Or will your fledgling empire fade into obscurity? Anything can happen in this strategic, infinitely-replayable game!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Players take the role of amateur cavers attempting to escape an unexplored network of subterranean tunnels, before the lights flicker out or the darker things beneath the Earth catch up to them...\n\nIn Sub Terra players spend their turn exploring and revealing the tunnel system around them, attempting to survive the various perils of the cave, from floods and cave ins to gas leaks and scree. Players each have a role which gives them specialist abilities, such as an Engineer with dynamite to blast a new route or a Scout to find a route more easily.\n\nNew tiles are placed from a randomised stack of cave features, which determines whether you\u0027ll be hit with a dead end or a range of new options.\n\nAt the end of each turn, players face the reality of their situation, with a hazard card drawn to determine what danger causes them damage or cuts off their way out of the horror below.\n\nThese cards are finite, and when they run out, your torches flicker and the air feels tight, and your chance of survival diminishes quickly.\n\n",

Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\n\n Star Wars: Destiny is a collectible dice and card game of battles between iconic heroes and villains that encompasses characters, locations, and themes from the entire Star Wars saga.\n\nIn Star Wars: Destiny, two players engage in a fast-paced duel, each striving to eliminate the other\u0027s characters first. The game\u0027s innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management. Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building. Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight. For example, Padm\u0026eacute; Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett.\n\nEach round, you use your characters\u0027 abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield. You need to prove your skills and defeat your opponent\u0027s characters to claim your destiny!\n\nAt launch in November 2016, Star Wars: Destiny consists of two starter sets \u0026mdash; Rey and Kylo Ren, each with nine dice and 24 cards \u0026mdash; and the Awakenings booster packs, each containing one die and five cards.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

In the polders between these windmills are fields filled with colorful tulips\u0026mdash;the flower that once was a part of the turbulent history of the first financial bubble but is now simply a quintessential part of the Dutch landscape, especially on the famous Bloemen Route (or \u0026ldquo;Flower Route\u0026rdquo;).\n\nIn Windmill Valley , a game inspired by the Bloemen Route, you and up to three players take on the role of tulip farmers and entrepreneurs. You will build and enhance your windmills, look for new tulip bulbs in foreign trades or among local vendors to buy and plant, and try to get an edge with hired help and lucrative contracts. Let your blooming fields make your competitors green with envy!\n\nDuring their turn, players choose the action by rotating the wheels on their windmill board. During the game they can:\n\n\n     Enhance their wheels, by adding enhancements, to build their engine\n     Plant tulips in their fields, which will score VP at the end of the game\n     Build windmills on the main board to activate rewards from adjacent fields\n     Hire helpers that provide bonuses for certain actions\n     Get contracts for endgame scoring\n     Visit the local market and conduct a foreign trade\n\n\nAll in all, Windmill Valley is a lightweight game with quick turns, a smart action-selection mechanism, multiple options to build your engine, and a lovely setting.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "France 1831: In a remote corner of Ard\u0026egrave;che, the little village of Peyrebeille sees numerous travelers pass through. A family of greedy rural farmers is determined to make its fortune and has devised a diabolical stratagem to achieve this goal: Invest in an inn so they can rob traveling guests, getting rich without arousing the suspicions of the police! Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive.\n\nThe Bloody Inn is a card game in which you play one member of a family of greedy, murderous innkeepers. At the start of each round, cards are placed face up to fill the inn with guests. Each card carries a cost representing how many cards a player must discard from her hand in order to take an action related to that card. Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player\u0027s hand after being discarded. Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses. A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order. Players choose one of the following actions:\n\n     bribe a guest into becoming an accomplice (take a card from the inn to their hand)\n     build an annex (move a card from their hand to their player area; it now represents a structure under which a victim may be buried)\n     kill a guest (move a card from the inn to their player area, awaiting burial)\n     bury a victim (place an unburied victim card under an annex card and take the money from the victim\u0027s pockets)\n     launder money (players may only have a certain amount of cash on hand; excess must be converted to 10F checks by the local notary)\n\n\nAt the end of the round, if any room of the inn contains one of the police, then they conduct an investigation; if a player has any unburied victims, then he must pay 10F per victim to the local gravedigger to hurredly \u0026mdash; and quietly \u0026mdash; bury the bodies! Lastly in the round, any cards (accomplices) in each player\u0027s hand must be paid 1F each. After the guest deck has been depleted the second time, players take a final round, then tally their francs. The player with the most money wins!\n\n",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nBlood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.\n\nThe Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.\n\nActions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.\n\nThe rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field. The game comes with plastic miniatures.\n\nThis game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.\n\n",

Choose one player to be the round\u0027s chief. That player gives all players a random card numbered 1-10, then they read one of the five hundred theme cards included in the game, e.g., \u0022Batman wants to replace Robin to fight the bad guys. Create a new duo \u0027Batman and ...\u0027 from the worst to the best.\u0022 The chief looks at their number, then gives an answer based on their number. If they have a 1, they want to give the worst possible suggestion; if a 10, the best; if a 5-7, somewhere in the middle.\n\nEach other player then gives an answer to this theme based on the number they were dealt, then the chief needs to decide who has the lowest number, then the next lowest, and so on. For each mistake, the chief flips a unicorn token over to its poop side.\n\nIf all the unicorns have left by the end of the fifth round, leaving you with nothing but poop, then you lose. Otherwise you win!\n\n",

The other player represents an independent investigator (not represented on the board) who tries to guess the identity of Jack \u0026mdash; but he can make only one accusation during the game!\n\nDuring each turn, the players move the characters, using their special powers and placing them either in shadow or light.  At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare whether Jack is visible \u0026mdash; that is, in light or adjacent to another character \u0026mdash; or not (alone in the shadows). This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent. As the turns progress, the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape. Intuition, logic, and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants.\n\n",

Undaunted, you journey to a strange land to reinvent yourself and reclaim your honor. Will you farm the earth, fight as knights or finagle your own feudums?\n\nFeudum (latin for fiefdom) is an economic medieval game of hand and resource management for 2-5 players. With many strategies at their disposal, players optimize four actions per turn in attempt to score the most victory points over five epochs.\n\nEach player controls several medieval characters that roam the countryside tending farms, taxing towns and taking outposts in effort to rise in power.\n\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s only the tip of the behemoth\u0027s horn! You will also compete to acquire coveted feudums, which increase your membership status in one of six guilds. But beware! Feudum owners must pay homage to the king through military service or face the charge of disloyalty.\n\nOnce a guild member, you will dutifully play your part in a progressive economic cycle, whereby the farmer ships goods to the merchant who equips the alchemist, who invents black powder, which arms the knight, and so on.\n\nIf you run your guilds wisely, maintain control of key locations and adapt best to changing events, you will be victorious. Unless, of course, you starve, get sidetracked by sea serpents or develop an unhealthy interest in fermented grapes. Long live the King!\n\n",

Japan, importing Western culture and eager to become one of the Grand Nations, saw the birth of many private railway companies and entered the Golden Age of railways. Eventually, as a result of the actions of powerful people and capitalists, many of these smaller companies gradually merged into larger ones.\n\nIn Trains, the players are such capitalists, managing private railways companies and striving to become bigger and better than the competition. The game takes place during the 19th and 20th century in the 2012 OKAZU Brand edition, whereas the 2013 AEG/Pegasus edition is set in modern times, with bullet trains, freight trains and more. You will start with a small set of cards, but by building a more effective deck throughout the game, you will be able to place stations and lay rails over the maps of Osaka, Tokyo or other locations. The trick is to purchase the cards you want to use, then use them as effectively as possible. Gain enough points from your railways and you will ultimately manage the most powerful railroads in modern Japan!\n\nTrains is the first title in AEG\u0027s Destination Fun series! Continue your travels in the acclaimed Planes and Automobiles board games.\n\nIntegrates with Trains: Rising Sun\n\n",

    "description": "What if the animals were the ones who ran the zoo?\n\n\u0026hellip;Presumably, this wild government would be built upon the support of fellow creatures and fueled by the fame, attention, and prestige of wide-eyed visitors.  Naturally, the most aspirational beasts would lobby for a position in the star exhibit, and the lead star would be elected Zoo Mascot.\n\nIn order to join the star exhibit, each species must campaign its way up the hierarchy of enclosures with the majority support of animal voters.  And the lead star will be the species that has earned the most laurels from both raving fans and jealous rivals along the way.\n\nHow does one gain support and earn laurels?  Through crafty politicking, clever negotiations, and ruthless schemes.  There can only be one Zoo Mascot, after all.\n\nWhere are you going? That is the ultimate question of Zoo Vadis.\n\nZoo Vadis is an evolution of Reiner Knizia\u0026rsquo;s classic negotiation game, Quo Vadis? It retains the elegant, political gameplay that fans have come to love while introducing many innovations and improvements by:\n\n\n     Enhancing the 3-player game and tailoring the board to all player counts through neutral, bribable figures\u0026mdash;roaming peacocks\n     Widening the player count with a second game board for 6-7 players\n     Expanding the possibilities for strategic negotiation with asymmetric animal abilities\n     Increasing tactical opportunities with new special laurel tokens\n     Broadening the appeal of the theme and presentation with vibrant zoo art by Kwanchai Moriya and Brigette Indelicato\n     Enlivening the production with chunky animal figures and functional player screens\n\n\nLike the original design, the game ends immediately when the Star Exhibit is full. Only the animals who have reached the Star Exhibit qualify for victory, and the winner is the player with the most laurels.\n\n\u0026ndash;description from publisher\n\n",

    "year": 2016,
    "description": "Ticket to Ride: Rails \u0026 Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe \u0026mdash; which means that you\u0027ll be moving across water, of course, and that\u0027s where the sails come in.\n\nAs in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails \u0026 Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so. When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they\u0027ve created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.\n\nTicket to Ride: Rails \u0026 Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)\n\nSimilarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.\n\nSome tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.\n\nEach player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.\n\nTicket to Ride: Rails \u0026 Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.\n\nPart of Ticket to Ride series.\n\n",

    "name": "Churchill",
    "year": 2015,
    "description": "The players in the game take on the roles of Churchill, Roosevelt, or Stalin as they maneuver against each other over the course of 10 Conferences that determine who will lead the Allied forces, where those forces will be deployed, and how the Axis will be defeated. The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.\n\nChurchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operations, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues.\n\nThe game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their \u0027seat\u0027. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is a historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin\u0027s paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side\u0027s effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will \u0027win\u0027 various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).\n\nThe game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent\u0027s network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side\u0027s network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies.\n\nOnce this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game. In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets. If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion.\n\nAs I stated this is not a wargame, but a three-player excursion into power politics. The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario. All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play. In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire. I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month. More to follow...\n\n",

Well, imagine a dozen or so random humans, robots, and none-of-the-aboves, each with their own abilities, goals, and secret relationships, have been turned loose on a space station that is going to be incinerated upon its inevitable reentry into Earth\u0027s atmosphere. You are one of these characters, and the others are collaborators you have on hand ready to assist you in achieving your goals. But choose them wisely, as any one of them could secretly be another player waiting to betray you! \n\n\nStationfall is a box full of creative solutions, but that box is going to morph, twist, and grow teeth over the course of play. Your best turns will exploit the unique tactical freedom of being a secret conspiracy, as well as deductions about your opponents\u0026rsquo; identities and motives. Stationfall is messy, intricate, and full of dangerous variables.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

The players form a loose band of mercenaries, but while they are united in name, actual alliances are shaky as players are pitted against each other in the quest to become the new leader of the Moonrakers.\n\nMoonrakers is a deck-building game in which players choose Contracts to attempt alone or with Allies in order to gain Prestige and Credits. After negotiating terms with Allies, players use their decks of Action cards to play Thrusters, Shields, Weapons, Reactors, and Crew to fulfill the requirements on each Contract. Each type of Action card has additional effects such as extra Actions, drawing additional cards, and protecting players from Hazards encountered while attempting Contracts.\n\nPlayers create powerful decks and gain special abilities by upgrading their ships and hiring Crew Members. This helps them accomplish more difficult and rewarding contracts alone, letting them keep more Prestige and Credits for themselves.\n\nAllies negotiate who will receive the Prestige, Credits, and risk of Hazard from Contracts, but if you don\u0027t make your offers enticing enough players may be tempted to betray you! The first player to 10 Prestige wins, but be careful as hazards encountered on Contracts reduce your Prestige!\n\n-description from designer\n\n",

In the process, you must expand your camp by placing Tetris-style tiles on your player board, gather elements needed for the shows, and set up performances in your tents.\n\nOn your turn, you take one die from the supply. The value of the chosen die is your strength. Add to this the value of all dice of the same color that you have already collected, then use this strength to carry out one of three main actions: build, travel or perform. The more strength you have, the better the action will be, but at the end of the round, you must pay \u0026mdash; in coins \u0026mdash; the total of your highest-valued dice color. Thus, taking dice of the same color makes for better actions, but will cost more coins.\n\nAfter each player has taken four turns, the round ends. Each player must discard one of their ringmaster cards and score points according to its requirements. After three rounds, the game ends, and the player who has collected the most points wins.\n\nIn more detail, players start the game with four ringmaster cards and a unique trainer tile. Each ringmaster card provides a special ability (which is triggered when you place a die on it) and a unique end-of-round scoring opportunity. When you choose a ringmaster card to discard and score at the end of the round, you must therefore also take into consideration which special abilities you want to keep.\n\nIn addition to your main action, you may use trainers on your personal unique trainer tiles or on common trainer spaces on the game board for various benefits.\n\nAt the end of each round, in order of the players\u0027 highest-ranked performances, players choose a new ringmaster card and a trainer tile, providing new abilities and scoring opportunities for the next round.\n\n",

Hence, he decides to offer a generous gift to a worthy mortal and invite him, or her, to his realm, to Olympus. To determine a sufficient candidate, Zeus hosts a competition for his entertainment. Twelve legendary tasks are imposed upon the fearless participants: to erect graceful statues, to raise awe-inspiring sanctuaries, to offer capacious offerings, and to slay the most fearsome monsters. The first participant to master all the posed assignments wins the favor of the father of the gods himself.\n\nIndubitably, you will not pass up this golden opportunity, so you clear your ship and rally your crew to follow on the trails of legendary Odysseus through the dangerous waters of the Aegean. But how could you find the righteous path onward? There is but one who can help you. Visit the mysterious oracle of Delphi and let her answers guide your ways.\n\nIn Stefan Feld\u0027s new game The Oracle of Delphi, the player\u0027s ships travel across a large variable game board of hexagonal tiles showing islands and the surrounding waters. Each player aims to reach certain islands to perform the twelve tasks given by Zeus: e.g., to collect offerings of different colors and to deliver them to corresponding temples, or to slay monsters of a specific type (and color), all of which can be discovered on the islands.\n\nIn order to execute these color-dependent actions, you are given three colored dice each turn, the so-called \u0022oracle dice\u0022. Rolling the dice (at the start of the turn) is equivalent to consulting the oracle, whereas the results represent her answers. The answers determine which actions you will be able to take, but you will always have three actions per turn. However, a slight divergence from your fate is often possible.\n\nIn addition to the oracle, you can request support from the gods and you can acquire favor tokens, companions, and other special abilities that will help you win the race against other competitors.\n\nDifferently equipped ships and the variable set-up of the game board will offer new challenging and interesting strategic and tactical decisions with every new game of The Oracle of Delphi that you play.\n\n",

The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn\u0027t go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!\n\nPlayers make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player\u0027s ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player\u0027s influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators\u0027 and Generals\u0027 positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin\u0027s blade.\n\n",

This costs action points, the exact number being dependent upon the building\u0027s size.\n\nIn the scoring phases of the game, players score points (El Grande style) based upon their dominance in a District. In the 4 player game, players with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most buildings score decreasing numbers of points.\n\nOnly districts are scored in the first scoring round.\n\nIn the second scoring round at the end of the game, all land areas are scored, not just districts.\n\nThe player with the most points wins.\n\nMexica is the third game in the Mask Trilogy.\n\n",

    "year": 2012,
    "description": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.\n\nThe initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile \u0026ndash; the safe room \u0026ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice.  Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you\u0027re at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you \u0022discover\u0022 magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile. The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren\u0027t back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.\n\nOnce the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven\u0027t been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.\n\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the \u0022Treasures\u0022 module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the \u0022Curses\u0022 module, some tiles \u0022curse\u0022 players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn\u0027t want to do while escaping a temple!\n\n",

Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.\n\nOn a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.\n\nOne of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player\u0027s fate deck, then play one of them on that player\u0027s board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player\u0027s locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain\u0027s movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.\n\nDisney Villainous: Evil Comes Prepared is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the Disney Villainous base game from 2018 and the Disney Villainous: Wicked to the Core standalone game in 2019.\n\n",

Whistle Mountain gives a nod to Whistle Stop, but in this standalone game, you leave the train tracks behind and head to the sky with blimps, dreadnoughts, and hot air balloons!\n\nIn Whistle Mountain, take your company\u0027s massive profits from all of that railroading and invest them in new technologies, deep in the Rocky Mountains where there is an abundance of resources. Your workers build crazy arrays of scaffolds and machines, upgrading your abilities and collecting resources. As you build with the help of your airship fleet, the mountain\u0027s melting snow causes the water below to rise higher and higher, putting workers in danger and increasing the tension on the dynamically-changing board.\n\nBecause the resources you gather are determined by what players build, each game evolves differently, resulting in endless replayability. You have to choose between acquiring new abilities and enhancements for your airships and workers or building all sorts of contraptions as quickly as possible in order to achieve victory on Whistle Mountain.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

As in other Pax games, you can acquire cards in a market, sell them out of the game, or play them into your tableau. You can also stimulate the economy by running trade fairs and trading voyages for Oriental goods. A map of Europe with trade routes from Portugal to Crimea is included, and discovering new trade routes can radically alter the importance and wealth of empires, ten of which are in the game.\n\nFour victories determine the future course of Western Society: Will it be towards imperialism, trade globalization, religious totalitarianism, or enlightened art and science?\n\n",

Soon after, the banks awarded millions of dollars in loans to six real estate investment firms to help develop this new area. The zoning map for The Estates calls for two rows of four buildings each, located between the River and Main Street. The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City.\n\nBut, with hopes of larger profits, investors and building tycoons entirely ignore the City Council\u0027s demands and begin developing three rows of buildings instead. The Mayor catches wind of the potential for profit and begins planning a new mansion in The Estates, which would double the value of one of the building rows! With some sketchy building permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone. However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: As soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there. At the end of the day, the investor with the highest-valued buildings will come out on top.\n\nThe players take on the role of investors seeking to make the most money by developing buildings in The Estates. Players will bid for the various building pieces and place them in The Estates to their benefit. All buildings in completed rows score positive points, while all buildings in incomplete rows score negative points. It is possible to have zero completed rows of buildings.\n\nA game of The Estates lasts around 40 minutes and can be played in several rounds to experience a shifting economy.\n\n",

In Fiends \u0026 Familiars, you befriended wild beasts and dispelled cruel spirits. Now your fully formed, battle-hardened heroes must defend the kingdom of Nalos and uncover a mystery that lies at the heart of the Abandoned Lands.\n\nNavigate your missions with care. It\u0027s up to you who to befriend and who to battle. Will you slay the giant troll or attempt to make peace? Will you do the vampire\u0027s bidding or defend the mysterious cultists he wants to destroy? Will you remain loyal to king and country \u0026mdash; or side with the enemies of Nalos? Whatever choices you make, someone will remember and respond.\n\nRoll Player Adventures is a co-operative storybook board game for 1-4 players set in the World of Ulos. Players take the role of fantasy heroes, face challenges, and make decisions that will change the story as they progress through eleven core adventures and a replayable side quest.\n\nAdventures does not require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play.

Following the Restorationist war, the northern hemisphere lands lay poisoned and starvation was the norm. Intrepid adventurers set out to explore and settle new lands. Little did they know, after the war, the surviving Old Ones and their remaining loyal human armies made their way to the outback of Australia to lick their wounds.  Build a port, construct railways, mine and farm for food. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to prepare for the awakening. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to fight.\n\nEverything you do in the game costs time, which is one of AuZtralia\u0027s most valued resources. At a point in time, the Old Ones will wake up and become an active player. They begin to reveal themselves and move, with potentially devastating outcomes. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to prepare wisely for the awakening and may have to co-operate with others to defeat the most dangerous Old Ones.\n\nMilitary units will help you to locate, fight and defend against the nightmarish beings that may be lurking on your doorstep. As well as hardware, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to recruit some Personalities who have the skills and resources to help you.\n\nRiches from the land, mixed with darkness and insanity await you in the outback. Will humanity prevail or will the Old Ones wreak their revenge?\n\nBy default, the game is semi-cooperative, where one wins or everyone loses. The rulebook includes a fully cooperative variant.\n\n",

    "description": "The theaters of London are abuzz. In one week, her majesty the Queen will attend their new shows and will grant her support to one of the troupes. It\u0027s the chance of a lifetime for the young authors who are inflaming the populace with ever more audacious and motley plays. But how do you create a masterpiece in such a short time? Whoever has the answer to this thorny question will probably enter the rolls of history!\n\nIn Shakespeare, players are theater managers who must recruit actors, craftsmen, jewelers and others in order to assemble everything needed for the play\u0027s performance at week\u0027s end.\n\nIn more detail, the game lasts six days and on each day players recruit one new character \u0026mdash; starting with five at the beginning of the game: four identical ones on their individual player board and one that they\u0027ve drafted \u0026mdash; and take 1-5 actions with the characters they have. Characters and their actions are:\n\n\n    Actors: Rehearse one or more acts in the three-act play; the more you rehearse, the more benefits you receive during the dress rehearsals on days four and six.\n    Costume mistress: Take costume elements to enhance your actors; if they lack a complete costume, they can\u0027t participate in the dress rehearsals.\n    Set dresser: Build the set. The more elaborate the set you build, the more rewards you receive \u0026mdash; but the set must be symmetrical!\n    Handyman: Set them to work on whatever you need. These joes can assemble both costumes and sets, but they\u0027re not very good at it.\n    Assistant: Increase the power of your craftsmen, i.e., the three roles described above.\n    Jeweler: Take a gold costume element or set piece to dazzle the crowd.\n    Queen: Earn money by giving her an early peek, or gain an objective to win her favor on the final day.\n\n\nAfter players take actions, they check the individual ambience level in their theater, gaining or losing points or rehearsal time depending on the atmosphere. Dress rehearsal on the fourth and sixth days provide another chance for fully-dressed actors to perform, and those who are well-rehearsed earn points or money.\n\nOn all but the final days, players must allow characters who performed to rest, with only one of those characters being able to work the next day. Thus, the more you put them to work today, the less you\u0027ll be able to do tomorrow \u0026mdash; but those who don\u0027t plan to do as much act before other players, so that might be a good thing.\n\nIn the end, players must pay their actors, with each unpaid actor blemishing your reputation and costing you points. Whoever finishes with the most prestige points wins.\n\n",

    "description": "Trapped in a drowned world, you and your allies are doomed -- or are you? Using a mystical deck and a healthy dose of logic, you can predict each others\u0027 fates and escape unscathed.\n\nThe Shipwreck Arcana is a compact, co-operative game of deduction, evaluation, and logic. Each player\u0027s doom constantly changes as they draw numbered fate tiles from the bag. By choosing which fate to give up and which card to play it on, you can give your allies enough information to identify the fate you\u0027re holding - which is important, as the active player cannot communicate with their allies during their turn!\n\nEach card has strict rules governing what fates can be played on it. As doom builds up, the cards themselves fade, becoming one-time powers to help the players while new cards cycle in from the deck.\n\nSkilled play requires carefully rationing powers, hints, and cycling, while paying attention to not only where each fate was played -- but more importantly, where it wasn\u0027t.\n\nThe rotating active player creates a different group dynamic each turn, preventing any one player from dominating the game. Inexperienced players can still use the group deduction phase to ask questions (while they are not the active player).\n\n",

The year is 1894, and the Snowdon Mountain Tramroad and Hotels Company Limited has been formed to build a branch line from Llanberis to the summit. You can scarcely believe it\u0027s possible!\n\nIn Snowdonia, players represent work gangs providing labour for the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway. Unlike other train games you will have to excavate your way up a mountain side, as well as make and lay the track, construct viaducts and stations. All this in competition with the weather of the Welsh mountains (and the game itself)!\n\nYou may be assisted by a train (though that\u0027s not always best) and you\u0027ll be able to collect essential materials from the Stock Yard. You will obtain special work contracts that give you bonuses.\n\nCan you contribute more than the other players to the magnificence of the Snowdon Mountain Railway?\n\n",

While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you\u0027ll have to be the most initiated traveler \u0026ndash; which means that you\u0027ll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things.\n\nThe potential action spaces in Tokaido are laid out on a linear track, with players advancing down this track to take actions. The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces.\n\nThe action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in different, but roughly equal, ways. Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points.  Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.  Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types.\n\nAll of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play.\n\n",

Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\nSummoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game.  Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race\u0026rsquo;s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.\n\nEach Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook.\n\nBut the war doesn\u0026rsquo;t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!\n\nSummoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.  During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines.  In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory.\n\n",

    "description": "A cooperative game where the players attempt to clean out an infestation of hostile aliens from a derelict spaceship. Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, players take on the roles of Space Marines pitted against hordes of Genestealers.\n\nPlayers choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities. Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams. After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers.\n\nGame play is quick and easy to learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move \u002B Activate. You can\u0027t pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.\n\nAction resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels.\n\nThe Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card. And then it\u0027s back into the fight!\n\n",

Each player occupies one of the four towers around the Witchstone and starts from there. Create your magic spells with the help of your cauldron, and put a network of magic energy around the stone. Send out your witches, scoop the magic crystals out of the cauldron, make use of the pentagram and the magic wand, and keep an eye on the prophecy scrolls in order to ensure victory.\n\nNot all options are always available to you. Only if you cleverly make the most of your opportunities will you have the chance of accumulating the most victory points over the eleven rounds and thereby win Witchstone.\n\nEach player in the game has a personal cauldron that bears seven crystals and six pre-printed magic icons, and they share a larger game board that features a crystal ball that shows the entire landscape. Each player has a set of fifteen domino tiles, with each half of the domino being a hexagon; each domino depicts two different magic icons from the six used in the game.\n\nOn a turn, you place one of the five face-up dominos in your reserve onto your cauldron, then you take the action associated with each icon depicted on that domino; if the icon is adjacent to other dominos showing the same icon (or the matching pre-printed icon), then you can take that action as many times as the number of icons in that cluster. You must complete the first type of action completely before taking the second action. With these actions, you can:\n\n\n    Use energy to connect your starting tower to other locations on the game board, scoring 1, 3 or 6 points depending on the length of the connection.\n    Place witches next to your starting tower on the game board or move them across your energy network to other locations. As you do this, you gain points and possibly additional actions to use the same turn.\n    Move your token around a pentagram to collect points and to acquire bonus hex tiles; you can use these tiles immediately for actions or place them in your cauldron to make future tile placement more valuable.\n    Move the crystals in your cauldron, whether to make room for future tile placement or to gain bonus actions by ejecting the crystal completely.\n    Advance on a magic wand to gain points and take additional actions, with the actions being doubled should you currently be the most advanced player on the wand.\n    Claim scroll cards that boost future actions or earn you bonus points at game\u0027s end depending on how well you\u0027ve completed the prophecy depicted.\n\n\nAfter each player has completed eleven turns \u0026mdash; which could equal 40-60 actions depending on how well you\u0027ve used your cauldron \u0026mdash; the game ends and players tally their points from prophecies and other collected scoring markers to see who has the highest score.\n\n",

These characters are the great saviors of their civilizations. Before they came into existence, the humans were plagued by monsters like chimeras that took away their lands and forced them to live in walled-off cities. When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.\n\nBut the time of peace was short-lived. A prophecy arose that if one Phoenixborn was able to absorb enough Ashes of others, they would ascend into full gods and take mastery over this world. This, as well as humans\u0027 greed for land, fueled the War of Ashes. The great cities now fight among each other, each one of them with a Phoenixborn at its helm, and you will decide who will rise and who will fall to ashes.\n\nAshes Reborn: Rise of the Phoenixborn, released in 2021, features the same Phoenixborn as in the original Ashes with the same cards, but some cards have been modified to balance them. (Publisher Plaid Hat Games estimates that about 30% of all cards across all expansions are being modified.) The rules have undergone a few changes as well, mostly to clarify powers. The Ashes Reborn 1.5 Upgrade Kit contains more than 350\u002B updated Ashes cards, along with an updated rulebook, allowing players to move from the original game to the new 1.5 rules.\n\n",

    "description": "Tiny Epic Dungeons is a fully co-operative dungeon crawler for 1 to 4 players set in the fantasy world of Aughmoore.\n\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons, players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss. Heroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u0026rsquo; path. Where there isn\u0026rsquo;t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\n\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\n\nThe game is played over two acts: The Dungeon, and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts, the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\n\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its\u0027 minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\n\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\n\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss! In order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect legendary loot, and supreme spells\n\nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect.\n\nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact?\n\nThe story is yours to tell in Tiny Epic Dungeons!\n\n-description from publisher\n\n",

    "year": 2009,
    "description": "A solitaire study of America\u0027s most bloody and heroic day in WWII. The player controls the US forces landing along the five mile stretch of Omaha Beach on D-Day and their desperate struggle to establish a viable beachhead. The game covers the entire first day at a time scale that varies from 15 minutes per turn (during the initial landings) to 30 minutes per turn later in the day. Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their \u0022Widerstandsnest\u0022 resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs. Rules cover amphibious landings, German fields of fire, artillery, tidal movement, and intangibles such as US leadership under fire and the initiative of the American GI. \nThere are two counter sheets, 55 cards, and one mapsheet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t=====There are 352 counters. The basic unit size is the US infantry company. German units consist of Widerstandsnest crews and reinforcement infantry companies. US tanks, and some US artillery, AA and anti-tank units are also included. US engineers are represented abstractly, clearing beach obstacles early in the game and opening traffic routes off the beach later in the game.\n\nThe 34\u0022 x 22\u0022 map depicts the entire 9km long Omaha invasion area and reaching 4km inland, at 250 meters per hex. Hexes are large (almost 1\u0022) so that symbology facilitating German placement, fire and actions can be seen without having to pick up units.\n\nThe time scale is 15 minutes per turn from 0600 hours to 1000 hours, shifting to 1/2 hour turns from 1000 to 1800 hours.\n\nA deck of 55 cards performs triple duty: determining results of US amphibious landings, determining an event each turn, and determining which German units fire or perform other actions each turn.\n\nThe game\u0027s solitaire system is based on that used previously in Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t=================Decision Games Omaha Beach official url: http://shop.decisiongames.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=1018%2D4P\n\n",

    "year": 2014,
    "description": "You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out \u0026ndash; or you will remain trapped forever!\n\nYou may wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type of room. In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.\n\nOnirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...\n\nSeven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:\n\n\n    \u0022The Towers\u0022 introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition.\n\n\n\n    \u0022Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions\u0022 adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.\n\n\n\n    In \u0022The Book of Steps Lost and Found\u0022, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.\n\n\nIn addition to these three variants from the first edition, there are four new modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box. Just like previously, each module consists of something that makes the game easier and something that makes the game harder:\n\n\n    \u0022The Glyphs\u0022 introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols. Player must then find one extra door of each color (so 12 doors in total) to win\n\n\n\n    \u0022The Dreamcatchers\u0022 are four cards that \u0022guard\u0022 the Limbo piles. The Limbo pile stays with Dreamcatcher until some effect allows the player to shuffle the pile back to the deck... if all Dreamcatchers are full and new cards should come to Limbo, a Dreamcatcher is discarded and his cards shuffled back. Also, four new \u0022Lost Dreams\u0022 cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss.\n\n\n\n    \u0022The Crossroads and Dead Ends\u0022 introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key), but serving as any color \u0022joker\u0022. It also contains 10 \u0022Dead End\u0022 cards, that remain in players hand (un-discard-able on its own) and block her 5-cards hand limit... until a player discards the whole hand (=the only way to discard a Dead End).\n\n\n\n    \u0022The Door To The Oniverse\u0022 brings several one-time abilities cards as \u0022inhabitants of the Oniverse\u0022... and one extra colorless door to find.\n\n\nApart from all those, there are a few special rules to use the dark meeple in the game (which interferes with Nightmare cards resolving), making the game easier or harder, depending on the chosen variant.\n\n",

You must balance your finances to optimize the various actions provided by the different gods, with each player gaining the support of only one god each turn. The game features a shorter and more dynamic bidding phase than the original Cyclades thanks to a new exponential bidding scale. Six gods are available instead of the five, increasing the variety of actions available.\n\nPlayers now use landscape tiles to assemble the modular game board during set-up, allowing for ever-changing maps and game strategies. New creatures and heroes are available in the base game, offering new strategic opportunities to build metropolises and gain decisive advantages on the battlefield. Your goal is to be the first to control three metropolises.\n\nCyclades: Legendary Edition features three game configurations:\n\n\n     \u0022Classic\u0022 mode for 3-5 players in which each player defends their own interests.\n     \u0022Team\u0022 mode for 4 or 6 players in which you play in teams of two, co-operating with one another and competing against others.\n     An enhanced and refined two-player mode.\n\n\n",

    "description": "Carcassonne: the Castle takes place in the city of Carcassone itself. The theme is development of the city within the \u0022castle walls\u0022, which might be more appropriately called the city walls, but Carcassonne: The City was apparently already in development.\n\nIt is not an expansion, but a stand-alone tile-placement game with the Carcassonne mechanics adapted specially for two players. The goal is to lead the race around the castle wall, which is also the scoring track for the game. There are bonus items on the wall for the first player to reach that point.\n\nPlay is very similar to Carcassonne but all the tiles must be played within the walls, which often constrains the choices. The followers used for scoring are heralds (on paths), knights (on towers), squires (on houses) and merchants (on courtyards which are more valuable if they have a market). And, the player with the largest \u0022keep\u0022 (largest house completed during the game) scores points for the largest contiguous undeveloped area (unplayed tile spaces) at the end of the game. The bonus tiles collected from the walls add twists to the scoring, such as doubling one of a particular scoring structure or scoring one uncompleted structure.\n\n",

    "description": "After the great Chicago Fire of 1871, the brave men and women of Chicago sought to rebuild their once-great city, and rebuild it they did. Over the next 60 years Chicago experienced an economic golden age, making such great progress that it hosted The World\u0027s Columbian Exposition in 1893, followed not long after by a celebration of its Century of Progress at The World\u0027s Fair in 1933.\n\nMany of the household brands we\u0027ve come to know and love today had their start in Chicago during this time period; Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift \u0026 Co, Armour \u0026 Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others made a home here in this tall, bold slugger.\n\nIn City of the Big Shoulders players take on the roles of entrepreneurs and investors seeking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for the world stage. In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest.\n\nAlthough City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games. Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours. Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade. At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends. Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago\u0027s greatest resident.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "name": "KeyForge: Call of the Archons",
    "year": 2018,
    "description": "From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen\u0026mdash;a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same. This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!\n\nAlong with this new breed of game comes a new world: the Crucible, an artificial world built from the pieces of countless planets across the stars. Here, anything is possible. This world was built for the Archons, god-like beings who, for all their power, know little about their own origins. The Archons clash in constant struggles, leading motley companies of various factions as they seek to find and unlock the planet\u0026rsquo;s hidden Vaults to gain ultimate knowledge and power.\n\nThis starter set contains two starter decks, two unique Archon Decks, and all the keys and tokens two players need to play!\n\nKeyForge: Call of the Archons is the world\u0027s first Unique Deck Game. Every single Archon Deck that you\u0027ll use to play is truly unique and one-of-a kind, with its own Archon and its own mixture of cards in the deck. If you pick up an Archon Deck, you know that you\u0027re the only person in existence with access to this exact deck and its distinct combination of cards. In fact, in just the first set of KeyForge: Call of the Archons, there are more than 104 quadrillion possible decks!\n\nEvery Archon Deck contains a full play experience with a deck that cannot be altered, meaning it\u0027s ready to play right out of the box. Not only does this remove the need for deckbuilding or boosters, it also creates a new form of gameplay with innovative mechanics that challenges you to use every card in your deck to find the strongest and most cunning combinations. It is not the cards themselves that are powerful, but rather the interactions between them\u0026mdash;interactions that can only be found in your deck. Your ability to make tough tactical decisions will determine your success as you and your opponent trade blows in clashes that can shift in an instant!\n\nKeyForge: Call of the Archons is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious \u0026AElig;mber, hold off your enemy\u0027s forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible\u0027s Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare \u0022Sanctum\u0022 at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.\n\nNext, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival\u0026rsquo;s forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more \u0026AElig;mber to your pool.\n\nNotably, no card in KeyForge has a cost \u0026mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more \u0026AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of \u0026AElig;mber, you won\u0027t move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six \u0026AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you\u0027ll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In Yamatai, 2-4 players compete to build palaces, torii, and their own buildings in the land of Yamatai. The game includes ten numbered action tiles, each showing one or more colored ships and with most showing a special action. You shuffle these tiles, place them in a row, then reveal one more than the number of players.\n\nOn a turn, each player chooses a tile, collects the depicted ships from the reserve, optionally buys or sells one ship, then places the ships on the board. The land has five entryways, and you must start from these points or place adjacent to ships already on the board. You can\u0027t branch the ships being placed, and if you place your first ship adjacent to another, then that first ship must be the same color as the adjacent one; otherwise you can place ships without regard to color.\n\nAfter placing ships, you can either claim colored resources from land that you\u0027ve touched with new ships this turn or build on one vacant space. To build, the space must have colored ships around it that match the ships depicted on one of the available building tiles. If you build a personal building that\u0027s connected to others you own, you receive money equal to the number of buildings.\n\nYou can bank one ship before the end of your turn, then you can use any three resources or a pair of matching resources to purchase a specialist, each of whom has a unique power.\n\nAfter all players go, you shuffle the action tiles, place them face down in the row, then reveal enough tiles at the front of the line to set up for the next turn, with the turn order being determined by the numbers on the tiles that players chose the previous turn. Once you trigger one of the game-ending conditions \u0026mdash; e.g., no ships of one color or no more specialists \u0026mdash; you finish the round, then count points for buildings built, specialists hired, and money on hand.\n\n",

The deck consists mostly of criminals, with Joker being the most valuable card at #8, Harley Quinn at #7, and so on, with Robin showing up at #4 and Batman as #1, which is the guard in the original Love Letter. Your goal is either to hold \u0026mdash; that is, have captured \u0026mdash; the highest valued card at the end of the round or to be the final player active in the round.\n\nFrom a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, using the power on that card to expose others and (possibly) knock them out of the round. If you use Batman\u0027s ability to KO someone (other than Robin), you score one point, with points being tracked via Batsignal tokens. If you\u0027re the final player active in the round or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point.\n\nThe game ends following the round in which someone has seven or more points, and the player with the most points wins.\n\n",

She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor. Eventually, she will have to come to a decision. Which Order will prove itself worthy to decide on her successor? There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.\u0022\n\n\u0022LUNA\u0022 is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.\n\nThe players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the \u0022worker movement\u0022 principle, i.e. they aren\u0027t placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you\u0027re in the right place at the right time, you\u0027ll gain the deciding influence points. You\u0027ll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess\u0027 divine services. But don\u0027t forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.\n\nLUNA: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements that takes about 20-25 minutes per player. The different placement of the islands and novices at the beginning of the game creates a different feeling each time you play and opens up new strategies.\n\n",

    "description": "In Myrmes, originally shown under the name ANTerpryse, players control ant colonies and use their ants to explore the land (leaving pheromones in their wake); harvest \u0022crops\u0022 like stone, earth and aphids; fight with other ants; complete requests from the Queen; birth new ants; and otherwise dominate their tiny patch of dirt, all in a quest to score points and prove that they belong at the top of the heap, er, anthill. After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength.\n\nIn game terms, each player has an individual game board to track what\u0027s going on inside his colony \u0026ndash; that is, whether the nurses are tending to larvae or doing other things, where the larvae are in their growth process, what resources the colony has, which actions are available to workers when they leave the colony, and so on. The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they\u0027ve developed the ant colony).\n\nThe game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn\u0027t tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.\n\nAfter three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can\u0027t. Whoever has the most points after three years wins. All hail our new ant overlords!\n\n",

    "year": 2014,
    "description": "In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.\n\nTo run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.\n\nYou fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.\n\nEach player has an own set of \u0022action tokens\u0022 like \u0022build and modernize factories\u0022, \u0022employ new workers\u0022, \u0022improve quality\u0022 etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the \u0022Administration board\u0022 and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (even numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).\n\nAfter each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.\n\nGoods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.\n\nAfter four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.\n\nArkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.\n\nTo get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version \u0022Spinning Jenny\u0022, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute \u0022Waterframe\u0022-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.\n\n",

    "description": "Speakeasy will transport you to the roaring 1920s during the era of Prohibition. Manhattan was under the firm control of Lucky Luciano, a prominent mobster. To strengthen his grip on the territory, he implemented a well-structured system. He divided Manhattan into different districts, each assigned to a specific mobster responsible for handling their \u0022business\u0022 operations.\n\nIn this worker-placement and card-management game, you take on the role of one of those mobsters, managing and operating your very own speakeasy empire in Manhattan. To do so, you\u0027ll need to use all your cunning and resources to stay ahead of the competition. As you improve your operation, become more infamous, and upgrade to more lavish speakeasies and even casinos, you\u0027ll attract the attention of the outside mafia and the police. You need to use your leverage to keep your business running and receive your share from Lucky Luciano.\n\nYou need to hire goons to help you take over Manhattan during this exciting and dangerous time. You can associate with outside mobsters \u0026mdash; and even attack and rob rum runners to gain valuable resources to gain an edge over your rivals. You need to manage your cards carefully, placing your workers strategically to deliver illicit liquor and reach Manhattan\u0027s goals to earn income. You will cook your books to fill your safes with free tax money by achieving some goals.\n\nThe ultimate goal is simple: accumulate the most money and become the most successful mobster in the city. Do you have what it takes to rise to the top of the speakeasy scene and take over Manhattan during Prohibition? It\u0027s time to grab your fedora and find out in Speakeasy.\n\n",

    "description": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends is a game played by masters of magic. Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent\u0026rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.\n\nThe game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player\u0027s own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings \u0026ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.\n\nTash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.\n\nIn melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don\u0027t expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.\n\nThe rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent\u0027s moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.\n\n",

In order to do so you will be transmuting mere metals into pure gold, performing experiments, and inventing artifacts to finally achieve everlasting greatness.\n\nTrismegistus: The Ultimate Formula is played over three rounds during which you will draft exactly three dice. By expertly utilizing the potency of your drafted die, you will be able to transmute precious materials, collect alchemical essences, purchase and activate artifacts, and perform experiments that will progress you along four mastery tracks. You will also build a secret hand of publication cards which \u0026mdash; together with the value of your experiments, the completed formulas of your Philosopher\u0027s Stone, and your collected gold \u0026mdash; will determine your final score in victory points and, perhaps, make you the greatest alchemist, someone able to rival Hermes Trismegistus himself!\n\nThe game features custom dice, the sides of which represent alchemical materials. At the beginning of each round, the dice are rolled and grouped by their respective types. On your turn, you must either draft a new die or utilize the untapped potency of a previously drafted die. Based on the material associated with your chosen die, you will be able to collect certain essences in addition to the material to which the die is keyed. Additionally, the color of the die will determine which types of transmutations you can perform, refining raw materials and increasing your mastery of the elements.\n\nAcquire precious artifacts in order to maximize the effects of your transmutations. Conduct experiments. Increase your knowledge and expertise and discover the ultimate formula!\n\nThe game includes a solo mode by D\u0026aacute;vid Turczi and Nick Shaw.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In the U.S. wild west, the eternal battle between the law and the outlaws keeps heating up. Suddenly, a rain of arrows darken the sky: It\u0027s an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?\n\nBANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.\n\nEach player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else\u0027s) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.\n\nIf a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who\u0027ll get his shot off first? Play continues until one team meets its winning condition \u0026ndash; and death won\u0027t necessarily keep you from winning as long as your teammates pull through!\n\n",

East Germany and West Germany become bitter rivals, each wanting to show its system is superior. Which will reconstruct quicker? Which will make its people happier? Socialism vs Capitalism; collectivism vs individualism - which will triumph?\n\nWir sind das Volk! (\u0022We are the people!\u0022 \u0026mdash; the main slogan of the East German demonstrators in 1989) recreates the history of the divided Germany, from the Berlin Airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Flowing from how the 84 individually designed action cards are played, each game is different. There are many possible strategies. Will East Germany build the Wall or stem the exodus of its citizens another way?\n\nEast vs West: as a player, you take the role of East or West Germany. Use your action cards wisely. Build up your economy and increase the living standards of your people. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall behind, or you will face widespread unrest. Also win the contest for international prestige. Precise planning is the key to victory. But be careful! Even the best plans may be derailed by events like the 1973 Oil Crisis or the Monday demos. Mass protests, that may seal your fate, are always on the horizon.\n\n",

    "description": "The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).\n\nPlayers compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards \u0026mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. \u0026mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose \u0022no trump\u0022. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.\n\nThe playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.\n\nAfter each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.\n\nAfter all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.\n\nA common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.\n\n",

Each other player then chooses one card in their own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller.\n\nIf no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then they receive no points; if they received some votes but not all the votes, they score based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on their card submission also scores. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most points wins.\n\nDixit: Journey differs from Dixit in a number of ways, starting with a simplified scoring board that doesn\u0027t have players moving around a track in the bottom of the game box. Instead the scoring track is on its own board, and this game board includes a summary of the rules as well as numbered places to put the cards each round to facilitate voting. The game rules  have been revised to make the game easier to learn, while keeping game play the same.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    Dixit 3: Journey \u0026ndash; In Europe, the cards from Dixit: Journey will be packaged as an expansion and not sold as a complete game.\n\n\n",

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.\n\nIn the game, each player represents one of the seven \u0022Great Powers of Europe\u0022 (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players must negotiate and make deals with other players in order to have any success in expanding their borders. They will make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. with two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: it can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold its position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of \u0022orders.\u0022 The outcome of the various orders is basically determined by the total strength of the units involved. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance.

Dracula uses a deck of location cards to secretly travel through Europe, leaving a trail of encounters and events for the hunters that chase him.\n\nMeanwhile, the hunters attempt to track and destroy Dracula using the limited information available to them - a task easier said than done when their prey has the power to change forms into a wolf or bat, and can even melt away into the mist when confronted.\n\nTo save Europe and rid the world of Dracula\u0027s foul plague, the hunters must destroy Dracula before he earns enough victory points to win the game... will they have enough wit and bravery to defeat the dark count?\n\n",

During your turn, you take a pair of identical tiles from the central \u0022castle\u0022 (known as the Dragon Castle) and place them on your own realm board to build your own castle. From time to time, you may sacrifice these tiles to acquire shrines in their place.\n\nEvery time you create a set of tiles of the same kind, you \u0022consolidate\u0022 them, i.e. flip them face down to score points. When you consolidate a set, you may also build shrines on top of the consolidated tiles: Shrines allow you to score more points, but they also limit your building options. You may also take advantage of the available spirit card and its game-changing powers...but this will come at a cost! Finally, don\u0027t forget to check the dragon card in play, and to follow the building requirements to score bonus points.\n\nWhen the Dragon Castle has been reduced to only one floor, the end of the game is triggered. After one final round, the player with the most points is the lord of the new Dragon Castle\u0026hellip;and the winner of the game!\n\n",

Alas, everyone was soon cheating, so the cats invented a very hot, often tearful, bluffing game.\n\nSpicy is a bluffing card game for 2-6 players. The cards are played face down, so you can cheat when you announce your card. That said, this clever card game isn\u0027t just about bluffing for you can almost always play a card that is at least half right if you cleverly play your hand. This means tactically deciding which card to use to get through: Do I play a \u0022Pepper 10\u0022 or a color wild on a \u0022Wasabi 9\u0022 and declare it a \u0022Wasabi 10\u0022? Or do I better pass because surely someone has noticed me thinking for so long now?\n\nSpicy contains six game-variant cards, but even without these a high replayability is guaranteed.\n\nThe cards are illustrated with forty separate pieces of art. In addition, not only the game box sparkles in chic metallic gold, but also the card backs are adorned with a gold-colored finish.\n\n",

Their armies decimated, they turn to you - the Dogs of War - to break their stalemate in exchange for fame and fortune.\nYou and your most treacherous friends will compete, each wielding a unique and powerful advantage over the others. You will raise armies to do these rulers\u0026rsquo; dirty works, fight their endless wars, and win at any cost. Allegiances - only as deep as your pockets are lined.\nEvery turn a single play might sway an entire battlefield to victory, acquire new armies, tactics, and gold, turn a hard-won skirmish into a crushing defeat, or hollowly divert attention from your true motives.\nAt the end of three long years of bloodshed, only the Dog of War most steeped in battlefield trophies and influence with the prevailing Houses will stand victorious.\n\nA curse shall light upon the limbs of men.\n Domestic fury and fierce civil strife\n Shall cumber all the parts of Italy.\n Blood and destruction shall be so in use,\n And dreadful objects so familiar,\n That mothers shall but smile when they behold\n Their infants quartered with the hands of war,\n All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,\n And Caesar\u0026rsquo;s spirit, ranging for revenge,\n With Ate by his side come hot from hell,\n Shall in these confines with a monarch\u0026rsquo;s voice\n Cry \u0026ldquo;Havoc!\u0026rdquo; and let slip the dogs of war,\n That this foul deed shall smell above the earth\n With carrion men, groaning for burial.\n    -Act 3, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s Julius Caesar\n\nDuring three rounds, battles between six \u0026ldquo;noble\u0026rdquo; Houses take place. Each player controls a Dog of War, choosing which House to support at each moment by sending their Captains leading Soldier Companies into battle.\nAs a House emerges victorious from battle, it becomes more valuable for the players who have influence with it. \nThere are many paths to victory for the Dogs of War. While earning influence with the prominent Houses is key, victory may also be achieved by defeating your opponents in battle and earning bountiful rewards and riches.\n\nNow, Cry \u0027Havoc!\u0027, and let slip the Dogs of War.\n\n",

    "year": 2005,
    "description": "(from GMT website:)\n\nEmpire of the Sun (EotS) is Mark Herman\u0027s third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in We The People. EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia. This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.\n\nAs in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent. The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices. The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance. The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.\n\nCombat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system. The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat. The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.\n\nThe key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will. The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically. The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States. The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan. It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.\nEotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind. EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours. If you are a fan of CDG\u0027s, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction. If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability. The game is comprehensive, but easy to learn.\n\nTIME SCALE: 4 months per turn\nMAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex\nUNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army\n\nDESIGNER: Mark Herman\nDEVELOPER: Stephen Newberg\nMAP \u0026 CARD ART: Mark Simonitch\nCOUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch, Dave Lawrence, \u0026 Rodger B. MacGowan\n\n\n(from the designer:)\n\nEmpire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system. The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia. EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges. Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign.\n\nThe game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc.), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level. The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.\n\nThe game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat. The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2. This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like.\n\nAs far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale. This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive.\n\nNorthern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs. If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war.\n\nAustralia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently.\n\nThen of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.\n\n",

It\u0027s known as the Savage Mountain, as it kills one person for every four who have reached the summit... Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory.\u0026nbsp;\n\nK2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players\u0027 teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.\u0026nbsp;\nYou can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.\nK2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.\nThe box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).\n\n",

Projects of such significance require the expertise of more than one person, so for each assignment you are paired with a partner with whom to discuss and execute your grandiose plans. Will your planning and collaborative skills be enough to design the most impressive city in the world?\n\nBetween Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city: factory, shop, park, landmarks, etc. You work with the player on your left to design the heart of one city, and with the player on your right to design the heart of another city. On each turn you select two tiles from hand, reveal them, then work with your partners separately to place one of those tiles into each of your two cities before passing the remaining hand of tiles around the table.\n\nAt the end of the game, each city is scored for its livability. Your final score is the lower of the livability scores of the two cities you helped design. To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion between two cities. The player with the highest final score wins the game.\n\nThe game features play for 3-7 players in 20-25 minutes, a 2-player variant for head-to-head competition as well as a solo variant (Automa).\n\n",

    "description": "Steampunk Rally is a strategy game that incorporates steampunk as more than just a bit of chrome. Using a unique dice-placement mechanism, players take on the roles of famous inventors from the turn of the last century like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie, constructing fantastical contraptions that make use of steam, heat and electricity in an attempt to win a no-holds-barred race through the Swiss alps.\n\nEach round starts with a card draft in which players carefully select machine parts to add to their invention and one-shot boost cards to aid them or hinder opponents. Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted.\n\nThen, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts. Driving through terrain causes damage, and if a player\u0027s damage gauge ends up in the red at the end of the turn, they must lose parts from their invention. These will need to be replaced in the draft phase, constantly forcing players to discover new synergies.\n\n",

    "description": "Diamant \u0026mdash; also published as Incan Gold \u0026mdash; is a quick, fun, press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.\n\nWhy would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they\u0027ve collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper \u0026mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.\n\nAll editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it\u0027s placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth extra points at the end of the game.\n\n",

Object of the game is to distribute your crop as effectively as possible in order to deliver faster than your opponents.\n\nFrom the Box: Mallorca, Island of the Wind. A place of golden beaches and a light-blue sea. The almond harvest is at hand, in addition, juicy oranges, lemons, and figs are ready to be picked and taken to the market. Olive trees bewitch the country with their curled branches and sumptuous vineyards invite passers-by to walk among their warm earth. In the midst of this landscape, your centuries-old natural stone farmhouse provides a home and supports your large windmill: your FINCA.\nListen to the wind, which propels your windmill! Then take in the course of the yearly harvest the sweetest and most valuable fruits from the land. Load them on your old donkey cart and travel around the island, selling them everywhere. If you manage this quickly, you will soon be the richest farmer on the island.\n\nNote: The Pandasaurus Games edition from 2024 plays up to 5 players while earlier editions play up to 4.

It is \u0026ndash; perhaps \u0026ndash; one of the most cruel and ruthless of all our games.

The public, media, experts estimate collections in four categories and award prizes and diplomas. The more awards (represented by \u0026lsquo;stars\u0026rsquo; in the game) will be collected at the show, the more money the players earn for selling their collection!\n\nWill you get award for best Trends? Will you manage to be best in Public Relations and get the Media award? Will you earn more \u0026lsquo;stars\u0026rsquo; than your opponent?\n\nIf you win \u0026lsquo;stars\u0026rsquo;, your opponents don\u0026rsquo;t.\nIf you win \u0026lsquo;stars\u0026rsquo;, you earn more money.

Your opponents don\u0026rsquo;t.\n\nThat is why during show you will kill for every single \u0026lsquo;star\u0026rsquo;. Welcome to the hell\u0026hellip;\n\n\nPr\u0026ecirc;t-\u0026agrave;-Porter is a 2-4 player board game, unique mix of deep economy strategy and direct interaction.

Many of the people the villagers used to depend on for essential things like food, shelter and clothes are gone. Craftsmen find themselves without suppliers of raw materials, traders have lost their customers and many have lost their farms and workshops as they escaped the plague.\n\nThe roads are full of refugees seeking a new beginning. They come to you, hoping to settle down on your land and make a living. Your grain farm is the ideal starting point for a village, reliably providing food for many people. You must choose wisely who you allow to settle with you, as your food and resources are limited.\n\nThe people on the road have valuable and unique skills, but they all in turn rely on other people with very specific crafts to be able to work. Raw materials, tools and services must be provided by other people from the road.\n\nIf you manage to find people that can work together to make a profit, while increasing your food surplus and capacity for building new houses, your village will be prosperous.\n\nThe game comes with a solo mode where a lone village strives to prosper in spite of the dreaded Countess and her evil machinations.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

You\u0026rsquo;ll need everything you can get; you\u0027ll have a small amount of resources and time, and you must grab the latest hot show before your opponents.\n\nAnd some Stars will give their best effort only if you put them on in the proper conditions. For example, some Stars only want to be put on dramas. Other Stars want to be the only Star on the show. And your Ads will give you the most money only if you put them on in the correct time slot.\n\nFinally, Shows age and viewers lose interest, so you have to keep your line-up fresh by canceling shows and sending them into reruns. Fortunately, you can get viewers from your reruns, and you\u0027ll get bonuses if you get a lot of shows of the same genre throughout the game.\n\nIf you need a special push, Network Cards can give you special powers \u0026mdash; but will a Network Card be better than another action? You\u0027ll have to make that call.\n\nThe player with the most viewers after five seasons wins!\n\n",

Over the course of both phases, you will expand your presence on the board by adding one new token each turn (either a settler or a village token). The goal is to collect the resources scattered over the map by placing your tokens on top of them. In the first phase, you can place a new token anywhere you like, as long as it is touching either the lagoon OR one of your previously played tokens. In the second phase, the board is cleared, except for the villages, and now you can only expand  from the villages you played in the first phase! At the end of both phases, players score points for the sets of resources they collected. Most points wins.\n\n",

Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!\n\nAn exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero\u0027s path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.\n\nIn Swamps of Death, players will encounter portals to the otherworld Jargono, a humid swampland inhabited by sentient reptiles, vicious dinosaurs and a tribe of humanoids, cut off from return to their homeworld untold years after their own portal closed.\n\nSo load up yer\u0027 six shooter, throw on yer\u0027 hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell\u0027s about to break loose...in the Shadows of Brimstone!\n\nCan be used together with Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients to raise the maximum players to 6.\n\n",

    "description": "Blue Moon City - the board game - picks up where the two-player game, (Blue Moon), ended: the reconstruction of the destroyed city of Blue Moon. The board, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel as well as many well-known American fantasy artists, consists of 21 large building tiles, which show building plans on one side and the buildings in their reconstructed glory on the other. As in the 2-player game, the game includes 3 large molded plastic dragons.\n\nAt the start of the game, the board tiles all show their building plan sides. The object of the game is to use cards featuring the races of Blue Moon to help rebuild the city and, at the end, put the large Crystal of the Obelisk in the middle of the city back together. Whenever a building is completely rebuilt, its tile is turned back over to its rebuilt side. The players who helped with a building get crystals and dragon favors, which can be traded in for crystals at certain times.\n\nThe player who first manages to add the required number of markers by paying crystals to the Obelisk wins the game. (four markers in a 4-player game, five markers in a 3-player game, and six markers in a 2-player game)\n\nThere are two mini-expansions for this game (Blue Moon City: Expansion Tile Sets 1 \u0026 2), each consisting of two tiles that can be added to the main game either separately or combined.  The first mini-expansion was included with the Der Knizia Almanach.  The second mini-expansion was included in the 6/06 issue of Spielbox.\n\nRules changes\n\n     Original Knizia design--after dragon scales score, ALL players discard scales.  This rule was modified by the publisher. [citation needed]\n     In original printings such as Kosmos and FFG for 4-3-2 players the game uses 15-12-9 dragon scales.  In later edtions new publisher CMON changed this to 12-9-7 scales.\n\n\n",

    "description": "Paris is a two-player board game by Jos\u0026eacute; Antonio Abascal infused with Parisian aesthetics by the boardgame\u0026rsquo;s artist Oriol Hern\u0026aacute;ndez. The game is set in late 19th century Paris during the 1889 \u0026ldquo;Exposition Universelle,\u0026rdquo; or World\u0026rsquo;s Fair, when public electricity was a hot topic. Electricity spread throughout the city, creating today\u0026rsquo;s beautiful nocturnal Parisian streets and coining Paris\u0026rsquo;s nickname \u0026ldquo;La Cit\u0026eacute; de la Lumi\u0026egrave;re\u0026rdquo; - The City of Light.\n\nThe most well-lit buildings are admired more highly by passers-by. In the first phase, players can either place tiles or grow their reserve of buildings. The cobblestone tiles are divided into 4 random spaces (their color, their opponents\u0026rsquo; color, a streetlight or a mixed-color space where either player can build).\n\nThen, in the second phase, players build on top of their color or the mixed spaces, in effort to position their buildings as close to as many streetlights as possible. More streetlights solicit more adoration and points. The player with the best lit buildings steals the hearts of Parisian pedestrians and wins the game.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Some built kingdoms below the surface of the green seas, while others controlled the desert-filled plains and cliffs. Among them we found scientists, inventors, farmers, traders and fighters. While our presence has been unsettling for some, we have had very few incidents with the locals. Still, we Circadians, Earth\u0027s famed explorers, must do what we can to ensure peace. We must respect this world and its hosts. The heads of Moontide passed down orders from above. We are to open negotiations with the three clans, in hopes of gaining their favor, along with our own security while on the planet. We must also collect organic samples for the depository on Moontide. This is new ground for all of us, but we must be brave and resourceful. The future of the Circadians depends on it.\n\nThe aim of Circadians: First Light is to lead a team of researchers on the planet of Ryh. Players need to manage their crew (dice) to visit various parts of the planet for trade, farming, construction and research. Players score points for negotiating with the locals, harvesting resources for the depository, upgrading their research base, exploring the planet, and collecting gems. The game is played over eight rounds. At the end of the final round, the player with the most points wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from designer\n\n",

The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.\n\n",

Resources can\u0027t be mixed across the planets, so you need to take special care with your planning.\n\nTo do this, you choose actions from the player board, with the expert variant adding cards to your hand that allow you to choose additional actions and combine them. Each action has its own value, and the sum of these actions is important for an \u0022end of the round\u0022 bonus. Additionally, players move their markers along the orbital track based on the value of their actions.\n\nIf you can raise production of three resources to level 8 and have three stadiums on the new planet, you win. Otherwise, players compare scores after four rounds. Evacuation includes modules to add new play options.\n\nNOTE: A community FAQ is available here to provide some clarity on Frequently Misplayed Rules.\n\n",

You may be the first to create an artificial satellite, send a probe to another planet, or even put a man on the moon.\n\nLeaving Earth is a game about planning and about managing risk.  With even a single grand journey into outer space, you might claim victory in the game.  Consequently, it is your job to plan each journey carefully, finding the cheapest, quickest, and safest ways to reach your objective\u0026mdash;but do not spend too long preparing, or another nation might reach its goal before you.\n\nOn your turn, you will be conducting research, building spacecraft, and directing journeys into outer space. To conduct research, you buy an advancement that begins with certain flaws, then you test the advancement to find and eliminate those flaws.  To build a spacecraft, you purchase components and assemble them into a whole. To travel to outer space, you expend rockets to maneuver from one location to another.\n\n",

Instead, you play a secret society that is betting on the results of this war while pulling strings to rig the results and ensure their bets pay off. A War of Whispers is a game of deep strategy, hidden agendas, and shifting loyalties.\n\nYou start the game with five loyalty tokens, each corresponding to one of the five different empires, bet randomly on a loyalty value. Your primary goal is to ensure that when the game ends, the empires you are most loyal to control the most cities across the globe. Gameplay consists of turns broken down into four phases:\n\n\n    Deploy agents phase: In player order (starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise), each player removes, then deploys agents to empire councils, the positions on the board marked Sheriff, Steward, Marshall, and Chancellor.\n    Empire turns phase: Each council position on each empire council will take an action. If a player has acquired cards, they may play them during this phase.\n    Cleanup phase: Add the turn marker to the next space on the turn tracker, then each player discards down to the hand limit of five cards.\n    Swap phase: In player order, each player may swap two of their unrevealed loyalty tokens. If you choose to do so, you must reveal both of the swapped loyalty tokens. They remain revealed for the rest of the game.\n\n\nGameplay repeats itself in this order four times. When the last space on the turn track is filled, the game ends immediately and scoring commences. The player with the most points based off their empire loyalties and the cities they control wins.\n\n",

Can you put the pages together in the best order possible? And are you prepared to sacrifice a species to develop your manuscript?\n\nIn the game, each player starts with a single card on the table, a card that shows some combination of the four possible resources in the middle of the card, in the corners of the card, or both. Players also have two resource cards and one gold card in hand, while two of each type of card are visible on the table.\n\nOn a turn, you place a card from your hand overlapping the corners of one or more cards you already have in play. Your starting card has four overlappable corners, while resource and gold cards have only three.\n\n\n    Resource cards have no cost to be played, and they often depict resource symbols in their corners.\n    Gold cards deliver points when played, but they often have a resource requirement, e.g., three fungi or two plant/one animal/one insect, and you must have those resources visible in your manuscript at the time you play the gold card. You score points from this card immediately, with some cards having a fixed value and others a variable one depending on how many of a certain symbol are showing or how many corners you covered this turn.\n\n\nIf you wish, you can play a card from your hand face down; such a card has four corners and one resource, but provides no points. After you play, draw a face-up card or the top card of either deck to refill your hand.\n\nWhen a player reaches 20 points, you complete the round, and each player takes one additional turn. Players then score points based on how well they matched two public objective cards and one secret objective card, after which the player with the most points wins.\n\n",

    "description": "Between 230 and 221 B.C., the ambitious and extremely young king of Qin, Ying Zheng, unified China, adding all the other so-called Warring States (ZhanGuo) to his empire. Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.\n\nPlenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn\u0027t waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.\n\nInternal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.\n\nIn ZhanGuo, you are the emperor\u0027s emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.\n\nEach player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor\u0026rsquo;s favors. Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms. Whoever is able to make the greatest contribution to the emperor\u0027s cause, while at the same time keeping the citizens placid, will be the winner.\n\n",

They\u0027re all rivals, but their budgets force them all to share a single rented submarine. In the rented submarine, they all have to share a single tank of air, as well. If they don\u0027t get back to the sub before they run out of air, they\u0027ll drop all their treasure. Now it\u0027s time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.\n\nGame Objective\nThe game takes place over 3 rounds, and the player to gain the most points over the 3 rounds is the winner. In order to gain points, you must bring the most ruins chips back to the submarine. You can only return to the submarine once per round, and you cannot progress more after returning. You cannot return to the submarine without bringing any ruins chips.\n\nTurn Progression\nOn their turns, players conduct steps 1-4 listed below. Players take turns, going clockwise around the board, and the round ends when all players have returned to the submarine, or if the air runs out at the beginning of someone\u0027s turn.\n\n1) Declare if you will turn back or not.\n2) Reduce air.\n3) Roll the dice and advance your game piece.\n4) Search.

Every turn you must choose a Role to execute (and like Glory to Rome or Puerto Rico, your opponents will get a chance to follow suit), and in doing so you will add one of those Role cards to your deck.

    "description": "In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects and to invest in their implementation.\n\nIf the pollution isn\u0027t stopped, it\u0027s game over for all of us.\n\nIn the game CO\u2082, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy \u0026mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise while learning still more from others.\n\nIn CO\u2082, each region starts with a certain number of carbon emissions permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.\n\nMoney, CEPs, green power plants that you\u0027ve built, UN goals you\u0027ve completed, company goals you\u0027ve met, and expertise you\u0027ve gained all give you victory points (VPs), which represent your company\u0027s reputation \u0026mdash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game \u0026hellip; in addition to saving the planet, of course.\n\nThis new totally re-designed edition of CO\u2082 features a completely new iconography, an entirely new rulebook with lots of 3D pictures for easy comprehension of the rules, more balanced gameplay, a new events deck, improved and streamlined mechanisms, and upgraded wooden components for the power plants instead of the cardboard tokens in a game with a shorter play length. This version also features a co-operative mode of play as well as solo play based on goals.\n\n",

The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile\u0027s yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.\n\nAt the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game\u0027s end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type \u0026ndash; the bigger the better. But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.\n\n",

For the past 72 years, Viking raiding parties from Norway and Denmark have been terrorizing the coasts of England with \u0026lsquo;hit and run\u0026rsquo; attacks. The treasures and stories gained from these attacks have allowed the Norsemen to raise huge hosts of eager men seeking glory and riches. These armies now stand poised to thunder across England where they will settle and farm the fertile land they conquer. The divided English kingdoms are unprepared for this impending onslaught. The Vikings are coming!\n\nIn 878: Vikings \u0026ndash; Invasions of England, players control the invading Vikings or the English nobles who are trying to withstand the invasion. Viking players either play as Norsemen Viking freeman or as the fearless Viking shock troops known as Berserkers. The English play as the Housecarl, the Kings\u0026rsquo; household troops, or as the Thegns who were regional noble Leaders. The English players will also be able to call up the peasant levies, called the Fyrd, to defend their cities.\n\nPlayers for each side strategize together in order to coordinate their strategies. Each side attempts to control Cities on the map to win. The English start the game controlling all of England but a Viking Leader will invade from the sea each Turn. The English players raise reinforcements from cities they control, while the Vikings must wait for a new invasion for reinforcements. The game ends when the Treaty of Wedmore is called and the side controlling the most cities wins the game.\n\n",

But can you find your way back before the portal closes?\n\nSleeping Gods: Distant Skies is a standalone sequel set in the world of Sleeping Gods. As in the original game, you and your friends trek through a vast landscape as you read branching storylines and meet vivid characters, but in this game you interact with the atlas on a deeper level \u0026mdash; camping, exploring, overcoming obstacles, and searching for lost relics. The new action system allows you even greater agency while you travel and explore.\n\nIn addition to the exploration and quest system from the original game, Sleeping Gods: Distant Skies features a fresh spin on combat. Players now build a combat deck from which they draw a varied hand of cards to play, making each combat encounter a fresh and dynamic puzzle.\n\nAlthough Sleeping Gods: Distant Skies builds on story elements in the first game, you do not need to play Sleeping Gods to enjoy this sequel. The game features new characters and storylines, explaining concepts from the original game as you encounter them.\n\nReturn to the world of Sleeping Gods and experience a thrilling tale that hinges on your choices in a truly open-world experience!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible. Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.\n\nThe more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?\n\nRailroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add special rules to your games. The Blazing Red Edition includes the Lava and  Meteor expansions. Try to confine the lava coming from the erupting volcano before it destroys your routes, or deal with the havoc brought by the meteor strikes and mine the craters for precious ore. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different.\n\nEach box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!\n\n",

Over the course of eight rounds, they\u0027ll double their workforce, open up new living space in the mountain, construct new buildings and rooms in which to live, and dig for precious metals.\n\nIn more detail, each player starts the game with an individual player board that\u0027s covered with a random assortment of face-down building/room tiles and only one space. Some tiles are face up and available for purchase at the start of play. Four action tiles lie face up as well. At the start of each of the eight rounds, one new action tile is revealed, then players alternate taking actions, with the number of actions increasing from two up to four over the course of the game. As players excavate their mountainous player board, new building and room tiles are added to the pool; some rooms can be used immediately when acquired, whereas others require the use of an action tile.\n\nAfter eight rounds, players tally their points for buildings constructed and gold collected to see who wins.\n\n",

Thus, Middle Earth Quest will take place in a time of growing darkness.  Players will take control of characters such as a Gondorian Captain, a Rider from the Westfold, or numerous other character types. Not only will characters be able to experience new adventure in Middle Earth, but we will carefully seek to tie in the experience with the massive amounts of lore and story that takes place around the edges of the central THE LORD OF THE RINGS storyline.\n\nMiddle-Earth Quest is a game of adventure and conflict set in the time leading up to the creation of the Fellowship. One player will adopt the mantle of Sauron and do his best to spread his evil influence across the lands. Up to three players become heroes and will do their best to foil Sauron\u0027s foul plots, and rally the peoples of Middle-earth to their side.\n\n",

    "description": "Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy\u0026rsquo;s capital.\n\nSet in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player\u0027s can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?\n\nWarhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.\n\nRather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games\u0027 LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.\n\nRather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is \u0022burned.\u0022 If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.\n\nWarhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:\n\n* 1 Rulebook\n    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions\n    * 4 Capital Boards\n    * 35 Resource Tokens\n    * 60 Damage Tokens\n    * 4 Burning Tokens\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBattle Pack Expansion Cycles:\n\n\n    \n        \n1) The Corruption Cycle:\n\n    The Skavenblight Threat\n    Path of the Zealot\n    Tooth and Claw\n    The Deathmaster\u0027s Dance\n    The Warpstone Chronicles\n    Arcane Fire\n\n\n2) The Enemy Cycle:\n\n    The Burning of Derricksburg\n    The Fall of Karak Grimaz\n    The Silent Forge\n    Redemption of a Mage\n    The Fourth Waystone\n    Bleeding Sun\n\n\n\n        \n3) The Morrslieb Cycle:\n\n    Omens of Ruin\n    The Chaos Moon\n    The Twin Tailed Comet\n    Signs in the Stars\n    The Eclipse of Hope\n    Fiery Dawn\n\n\n4) The Capital Cycle:\n\n    The Inevitable City\n    Realm of the Phoenix King\n    The Iron Rock\n    Karaz-a-Karak\n    City of Winter\n    The Imperial Throne\n\n\n\n        \n5) The Bloodquest Cycle:\n\n    Rising Dawn\n    Fragments of Power\n    The Accursed Dead\n    Vessel of the Winds\n    Portent of Doom\n    Shield of the Gods\n\n\n6) The Eternal War Cycle:\n\n    Days of Blood\n    Oaths of Vengeance\n    Battle for the Old World\n    Glory of Days Past\n    The Ruinous Hordes\n    Faith and Steel          \n\n\n\n        \n7) Deluxe Expansions:\n\n    Assault on Ulthuan\n    March of the Damned\n    Legends\n    Cataclysm\n    Hidden Kingdoms\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n",

In addition to the standard sixteen cards in the Love Letter game are new versions of the cards that include special \u0022insanity\u0022 powers. If you have one of these cards in your discard pile, then you are insane (at least for the current round) and on future turns can play insanity cards for their regular power or their special power, giving you more options during play. The risk, however, is that you must undergo a sanity check at the start of each of your turns, drawing as many cards from the deck as the number of insanity cards in front of you; draw one or more insanity cards, and you\u0027re out for the round.\n\nIf you win the game, whether by being the last person standing or the player with the highest single card after the deck runs out, you win a token colored to reflect whether you were sane or insane. Win enough tokens of the right type, and you win the game. Cthluhu can also help you win the game if you release it at the right time...\n\nWill you put an end to the evil schemes as an investigator, or will you help guide the world to destruction as one of insanity\u0027s disciples? It all depends on you.\n\n1920\u5E74\u4EE3\u3001\u4E16\u754C\u306F\u3044\u307E\u3060\u7B2C\u4E00\u6B21\u5927\u6226\u5F8C\u306E\u6DF7\u8FF7\u306E\u4E2D\u306B\u3042\u3063\u305F\u3002\u305D\u3093\u306A\u6298\u3001\u3042\u306A\u305F\u306E\u8EAB\u5185\u3001\u3042\u308B\u3044\u306F\u53CB\u4EBA\u304C\u3001\u4E0D\u53EF\u601D\u8B70\u306A\u51FA\u6765\u4E8B\u306B\u906D\u9047\u3059\u308B\u3002\u5468\u56F2\u306B\u73FE\u308C\u305F\u5947\u5999\u306A\u4EBA\u5F71\u3001\u8AAD\u3081\u306A\u3044\u6587\u5B57\u3067\u7DB4\u3089\u308C\u305F\u624B\u7D19\u3001\u305D\u3057\u3066\u3001\u7A81\u7136\u306E\u5931\u8E2A\u3002\n\n\u3042\u306A\u305F\u306F\u4F1D\u624B\u3092\u983C\u308A\u306B\u3001\u3053\u306E\u4E8B\u4EF6\u306E\u8ABF\u67FB\u3078\u3068\u4E57\u308A\u51FA\u3057\u305F\u3002\u305D\u306E\u5148\u306B\u3069\u306E\u3088\u3046\u306A\u6050\u308D\u3057\u3044\u4E8B\u5B9F\u304C\u5F85\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308B\u304B\u3082\u77E5\u3089\u305A\u306B\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u3002\n\n\u672C\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u306F\u3001\u30E9\u30D6\u30EC\u30BF\u30FC\u306E\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30B7\u30B9\u30C6\u30E0\u3067\u30AF\u30C8\u30A5\u30EB\u30D5\u306E\u4E16\u754C\u89B3\u3092\u8868\u73FE\u3057\u305F\u30AB\u30FC\u30C9\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u3067\u3059\u3002\u901A\u5E38\u306E\u30AB\u30FC\u30C9\u30BB\u30C3\u30C8\u306B\u52A0\u3048\u3066\u3001\u6050\u308B\u3079\u304D\u529B\u3092\u6301\u3064\u72C2\u6C17\u30AB\u30FC\u30C9\u304C\u65B0\u305F\u306B\u5C0E\u5165\u3055\u308C\u3001\u5143\u306E\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u3068\u306F\u7570\u306A\u308B\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u5C55\u958B\u3092\u697D\u3057\u3080\u3053\u3068\u304C\u3067\u304D\u307E\u3059\u3002\n\n\u63A2\u7D22\u8005\u3068\u3057\u3066\u9670\u8B00\u3092\u672A\u7136\u306B\u9632\u3050\u306E\u304B\u3001\u72C2\u6C17\u306E\u4FE1\u5F92\u3068\u306A\u3063\u3066\u4E16\u754C\u3092\u7834\u6EC5\u306B\u5C0E\u304F\u306E\u304B\u3002\u305D\u308C\u3089\u306F\u5168\u3066\u3042\u306A\u305F\u306E\u9078\u629E\u6B21\u7B2C\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n",

    "description": "Historically, Albrecht von Wallenstein, duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg, was one of the most important mercenary commanders of the Imperial army during the Thirty Years\u0027 War (1618-48). His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at L\u0026uuml;tzen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia.\n\nThe game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries. Player actions include the conquest of new countries, tax collection, erection of buildings (i.e. development of the economy), feeding the populace, victualing the army, etc. Some actions increase the chance for unrest, and expensive rebellions can occur. The strongest power at the end wins.\n\nEmploys the cube tower included in the publisher\u0027s previous game, Im Zeichen des Kreuzes.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Shogun\n    Wallenstein (Second Edition)\n\n\n",

    "description": "Gloomhaven: Buttons \u0026 Bugs is a solo play game, with an original campaign story written by Isaac Childres, that features a playstyle similar to Gloomhaven in a fraction of the size.\n\nGloomhaven: Buttons \u0026 Bugs is set after the events of Gloomhaven and Forgotten Circles. The Aesther recluse Hail has earned a reputation for being highly instrumental in saving the city from recurring disasters, and she absolutely hates it. Wannabe heroes are constantly barging in on her studies at the Crooked Bone, looking for help in becoming famous themselves \u0026mdash; not to mention all the demons that come by looking for vengeance. She briefly considered moving, but as that would require effort, she instead just placed an enchantment on her front door: Anyone who attempts to open it becomes miniaturized and therefore is no longer a problem.\n\nYour character is one such wannabe hero. In an ill-advised attempt at fame, they try to visit Hail, and poof. Now they\u0027re the size of a mouse and have entered an entirely different realm of lawlessness and self-preservation. They must find a new way into the Crooked Bone to convince Hail to return them to their previous size.\n\nEach scenario is a single card, pitting one mercenary against a handful of enemies with simplified actions and AI. Each mercenary has a hand of just four double-sided cards, but they can be used twice \u0026mdash; both the front and the back \u0026mdash; before they are discarded. Attacks are resolved using a die in conjunction with a modifier table, and both the table and the mercenary ability cards can be improved as you level up throughout the campaign.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

Thedorius always cared more for the well-being of his subjects than for power or riches. Therefore, only the nobleman who is able to care for Emara\u0027s citizens as well as Thedorius himself did shall become Thedorius\u0027 successor and wear the Crown of Emara.\n\nTo test the skills of all aspirants, Thedorius and his counselors issue a challenge of practical use: Whoever can persuade the majority of the newly arrived citizens in the capital to support their claim shall become the future king of Emara. To achieve this, players have to cater to the citizens\u0027 needs and \u0026mdash; most importantly \u0026mdash; offer proper housing for everyone. This means that promoting the building activities in town will be one of the major tasks of the candidates.\n\nCrown of Emara skillfully combines card actions with worker movement actions, allowing players to plan their turns carefully during their downtime. The two counselors available to every player move in two separate roundabouts, requiring players to optimize every move. Additionally, two scoring tracks lead to a multidimensional playstyle as only the lower score counts towards victory and thus both tracks have to be advanced equally.\n\n",

Recently, the Mayor and Village Council have announced an opening for a Grand Librarian: a prestigious (and lucrative) position they intend to award to the most qualified villager! Unfortunately, several of your book collector colleagues (more like acquaintances, really) are also candidates.\n\nTo outshine your competition, you need to expand your personal library by sending your trusty assistants out into the village to find the most impressive tomes. Sources for the finest books are scarce, so you need to beat your opponents to them when they pop up.\n\nYou have only a week before the Mayor\u0027s Official Inspector comes to judge your library, so be sure your assistants have all your books shelved! The Inspector is a tough cookie and will use her Official Checklist to grade your library on several criteria including shelf stability, alphabetical order, and variety \u0026mdash; and don\u0027t think she\u0027ll turn a blind eye to books the Council has banned! You need shrewd planning and cunning tactics (and perhaps a little magic) to surpass your opponents and become Grand Librarian!\n\n",

    "description": "It\u0027s been twenty years since Victor Frankenstein died on a ship in the arctic, but his vengeful creature lives on, as does Robert Walton, the sea captain who vowed to kill the fiend before mercy stayed his hand. It\u0027s now 1819, and a sinister darkness descends upon the city of Paris. A mysterious benefactor of gigantic stature has emerged in the scientific community, never showing his face, claiming to possess the late Frankenstein\u0027s research. He sponsors a grand competition, offering an even grander prize: unlocking the mystery of mortality!\n\nRenowned scientists from around the world come to take part: some drawn to solve this eternal riddle, others coerced against their will. But a certain captain comes as well, one deeply suspicious of the secretive patron, hoping to finally fulfill his vow.\n\nAbomination: The Heir of Frankenstein is a competitive game of strategic monster building for 2-4 players, inspired by Mary Shelley\u0027s classic novel of gothic horror. In the game, the creature demands your help to accomplish what his own creator would not: to bring to life an abomination like itself, a companion to end its miserable solitude. Through worker placement and careful management of decomposing resources, you\u0027ll gather materials from the cemeteries and morgues around the city, conduct valuable research at the Academy of Science, hire less-than-reputable associates, and toil away in your lab \u0026mdash; all in an effort to assemble a new form of life and infuse it with a \u0022spark of being\u0022. Do well, and the creature may reward you during one of its surprise visits; do poorly, and you may come to regret not putting forth more effort. Narrative elements come into play throughout the game, guided by your decisions, leading to potentially unsavory outcomes.\n\nThe game ends when you succeed in bringing your creation to life or when the Captain kills the creature, whichever happens first. Then the player with the most points fulfills Frankenstein\u0027s dark legacy, becoming his heir, for good or ill...\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Heroes of Land, Air \u0026 Sea is an immersive and strategic 4X-style board game that transports players into a world of epic battles between orcs and humans, dwarves and elves, and warring kingdoms. With beautifully crafted miniatures, this game brings to life the thrilling tale of heroes who shape the course of war.\n\n\nIn this game, players take on the role of one of these iconic factions, vying to expand their kingdom and conquer new territories. Every great kingdom starts small, and players begin their journey with just a humble town hall, a handful of peons, and a lone warrior. From this modest beginning, players must venture out, explore the surrounding lands, strengthen their workforce, build a formidable army, and develop their kingdom. This requires careful decision-making, resource management, and strategic warfare.\n\n\nAs players progress and achieve milestones in their kingdom\u0027s development, they unlock a multitude of advantages. Peons evolve into mighty warriors, warriors ascend to become powerful heroes, and town halls transform into majestic castles. Players also gain access to water vessels and air vessels, as well as mythical creatures. By boarding these vessels and creatures with their units, players can traverse the expansive game board more swiftly and position their armies for devastating attacks.\n\n\nWarfare in Heroes of Land, Air \u0026 Sea employs a meticulously designed cost/reward system, outlined on tactics cards that players must secretly select. The availability of these tactics cards depends on the units involved in the conflict. It is during these intense battles that players must showcase their strategic prowess and fight for victory, knowing that history is written by the victors.\n\n\nFurthermore, Heroes of Land, Air \u0026 Sea features two distinct economic systems. The first involves the risky acquisition and careful management of vital resources such as food, ore, and mana. The second system introduces a unique twist on worker placement, where players must strategically allocate their peons to construct buildings. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that these peons could also be utilized for exploration, expansion, exploitation, or even extermination! Achieving the perfect equilibrium between these two systems is absolutely pivotal for securing victory in this thrilling game.\n\n",

A few savvy business tycoons (you and your opponents) are determined to make your fortunes on the crest of this wave. These tycoons start out as the producers of the key commodities: wheat to feed the growing towns and factories, wood and iron to build them, coal to fuel the trains and factories, and manufactured goods and luxuries to fill the insatiable demand of the animals of Astoria.\n\nCornering the market for the most valuable commodities can create small fortunes that can be invested in the new businesses, turning them into huge fortunes. The sky is the limit during this Gilded Age!\n\nIn Raccoon Tycoon, players try to produce the most valuable commodities in an ever-changing marketplace. They then use those commodities to build towns, or sell them at the best price to secure great profits that can be used to win auctions for the all-important railroads. The profits may also be used to buy powerful buildings that give the players power-ups or bonuses in production. Owning the best towns and railroads determines victory. There can be only one \u0022top dog\u0022 in Astoria. Is it you?\n\n",

    "description": "In 1703, Czar Peter the Great founded Saint Petersburg in Russia, which quickly earned the nickname \u0022Paris of the East.\u0022 The Winter Palace, the Hermitage, the Church of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, and many other buildings still amaze visitors from around the world today. To accomplish this, he needed a new administration and brought the aristocrats under his control. This was also a golden time for the workers as their skills were much needed to reform and build the new Russia.\n\nIn Saint Petersburg, players play important roles in building the city of Saint Petersburg. To do this, they will take turns selecting and purchasing cards from the display of available workers, buildings and nobles. Each type of card has an associated phase, and at the end of each phase, players earn rubles and score victory points based on the cards they have collected of that type. When one of the decks runs out, the players play until the end of that round, then the game is over. Additional victory points are awarded at the end of the game depending on the number of unique nobles that each player has, and the player with the most victory points wins the game.\n\nThis new edition of Saint Petersburg features an additional optional module, the Market, which adds a new card type, the market cards, and a new Market phase with its own rules for scoring points. These cards bring in new resources and not only allow for new tactical opportunities, as having a majority in  provides extra victory points during the market phase scoring, but also allow for a fifth player to join the game. This edition also includes the two expansion modules from the original edition plus four entirely new modules, that can be used on their own or mixed and matched as players like.\n\n",

You will arrive in a vast and rich territory, but the road to the prosperity is filled with challenges.\n\nIn Brazil: Imperial, you need to construct buildings, manage resources, explore the land, create trade, acquire the support of the greatest personalities of the country, and recruit a powerful army to protect your interest against the rival states. If you make the right choices, you can complete missions to progress to a more advanced era, receiving new interesting options of development and victory points. In the end, the best monarch receives the title of Brazilian Emperor and constructs a new era of prosperity, freedom and peace!\n\nIn more detail, while playing in a modular map board that recreate real regions, you use a combination of worker placement, area majority, and individual powers to construct an empire in Brazil between the 16th and 19th centuries. You start by choosing one of the available monarchs and its personal game board and components; some monarchs are strong in combat, while others prioritize science or exploration. You receive tasks that advance you to a new era when you complete them, giving you access to more power constructions as you move into the second and third eras of the game, then you choose a starting point on the shared map.\n\nOn each turn, you can participate in an action phase and a movement phase. You manage actions on your individual game board, and you have these seven choices:\n\n\n    Deploy: Summon one military unit to explore and defend your territory.\n    Frame: Buy cards that represent famous historic figures to receive special powers and victory points.\n    Build: Construct farms, mines, cities, and other structures to generate resources and do other things.\n    Renovate: Overhaul an old building to produce new resources.\n    Manufacture: Produce basic resources \u0026mdash; wood, sugar cane, cotton, or coffee \u0026mdash; to receive victory points, improve your \u0022action arches\u0022, and have raw material for more valuable products.\n    Harbor: Go to the port to receive a small amount of basic resources.\n    Trade: Sell your basic resources to receive gold and special cards to improve your empire.\n\n\nDuring the movement phase, you can explore hidden places or attack other players. For combat, you check the power of the troops involved in the conflict to determine the winner, with cards being able to modify these values. Once a player completes their goals in the third era, the game ends and players tally their scores.\n\nBrazil: Imperial was developed with the concept of it being \u0022Euro X\u0022, a new style of game that combines Eurogames (in which you collect and manage resources) and 4x games (in which you explore, expand, exploit and exterminate). A new concept of maps was also introduced in this game. All maps are different and created with modular boards that recreate real regions of Brazil and the world. Each game you can focus on resource management, combat, or a combination of both, depending on your choice of monarch and the interaction with other players.\n\n",

As such, you will have to lead your family to prove that you are the most deserving of leading the entire colony. Thanks to your extraordinary skills, you will be able to explore the Farm until you reach the pantry to be able to grab the appetizing cheese; exploiting the artifacts abandoned by humans at the edge of the Wood, you will create new inventions and expand your lair under the trees, digging new rooms and building new beds. You will meet native rats and mice that you will welcome into your family, and when necessary, you will visit the Alchemist mouse to gain some extra advantage.\n\nThe game takes place over 5 rounds (equal to the 5 days in which the challenge takes place) and you will earn victory points (VPs) as follows:\n\n\n     build beds,\n     excavation rooms,\n     by solving missions within the Farm,\n     welcome host mice,\n     build new Inventions,\n     claim Achievements.\n\n\nAt the end of the game, the player with the most VPs wins.

According to the sonnets, the Dark Lady seduced the poet and held him in an agonised thrall while also conducting an affair with the Fair Youth whom Shakespeare also loved.\n\nIn Black Sonata you will find yourself in Shakespeare\u0027s London, circa 1600, in pursuit of the shadowy Lady. A specially ordered deck of cards determines her hidden movements from place to place. You must deduce her location and then intercept her to catch a glimpse and gain a clue to her identity. You will need several clues to deduce her identity, but with each clue gained the Lady becomes harder to track. Black Sonata combines hidden movement and logical deduction into a unique solitaire steeped in literary history.\n\nCan you finally solve English literature\u0027s greatest mystery? Or will the Dark Lady elude you, melting from your grasp like a curl of smoke and promises?\n\n",

Your elite Bomb Defusal Team (BDT) has been called upon to neutralize the threat. Does your team have what it takes to work through the intricacies of the bombs and defuse them all in time?\n\nFUSE is a real-time co-operative game that employs 25 dice and 65 cards. Each game is set to a ten-minute timer, and players must work together in that ten minutes to defuse all of the bombs. Each bomb is represented by a card which needs a certain combination of dice in order to defuse it. A player will draw a number of dice equal to the number of players out of a bag and roll them. Players must then decide who will get which dice, but each player must take one and only one.\n\nIt\u0027s a simple task: maximize the potential of your dice among all of the players. The problem is that you have only ten minutes, and there are more than twenty bombs on your ship. You don\u0027t have time to think through every option. You barely have time to yell at Grandma as she reaches for that red die you need. This game will self-destruct in ten minutes...\n\n",

    "description": "Space Hulk is a light miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).\n\nYou lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.\n\nEach game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.\n\nThe miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.\n\nThe Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.\n\nThe Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers.\n\nThere was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games. This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons.\n\nEven with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K.\n\nRe-implemented by:\nSpace Hulk (2nd Edition)\nSpace Hulk (3rd Edition)\nSpace Hulk (4th Edition)\n\n",

The merchants contend to sell their goods to the arriving adventurers at the cove\u0026rsquo;s piers\u0026mdash;the most famous markets in the Five Realms. Each player uses their own set of role-specific components and gameplay mechanisms to produce their goods, increase their shop\u0026rsquo;s efficiency, and\u0026mdash;most importantly\u0026mdash;get rich!\n\nThough the merchants work independently in their specialized shops, they compete against each other to attract customers, influence the demands for goods, and secure sponsorships from the four faction halls. To get an edge, merchants can employ local townsfolk to work in their shops as staff.

    "description": "Primal: the Awakening is a fully cooperative monster hunting miniature boardgame for 1-4 players set in a fantasy world where humans struggle to survive an untamed wilderness. The game is played in a series of multiple sessions throughout an epic campaign where you will take the role of hunters fighting monstrous creatures and unveiling mysteries about their origins.\n\nIn Campaign mode, players will choose their path through the story by completing quests and unlocking special rewards and achievements. Each mission you choose will lead to different developments of the story and to plenty of unique opportunities like crafting options, unique items and rare hunts to be played. The consequences of your actions will impact the story as the campaign progresses towards the epic finale. Players can also play one-shot encounters in the Hunt mode. Specific setup and rules are provided for single combat scenarios at different levels of gear and difficulty. The Hunt mode also offers the opportunity to play special end-game quests using your campaign characters.\n\nThe gameplay is centred on an intense and challenging boss-fight system that combines tactical positioning on the board, hand management and cooperative play. The combat is designed to be fast paced while focusing on card combos and player interaction. Each monster is a unique challenge that hunters will have to face as a group, completing specific objectives and adopting different strategies. Monsters have their own specific deck of cards which represents their specific combat behaviour including attacks targeting specific areas on the board, special abilities, but also weaknesses and vulnerabilities that hunters can take advantage of during combat.\n\nThe game also focuses on a deep character customization. As the campaign progresses, players will unlock a large variety of crafting options as they upgrade and expand the Forge depending on the specific monsters they slay. \nAs the hunters level up from session to session, players will also have multiple choices to customize their deck of ability cards in order to build better synergies, card combos and group strategies.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

The cards in your deck start out very basic, but over the course of the game you add new and more powerful cards to it. You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board. You then use the minerals you\u0027ve collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck. Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill. Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs). You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.\n\nSuper Motherload features game boards that are added and removed during play to create videogame-like scrolling action, and it challenges spatial relation skills for 2-4 players who love video games, Eurostyle board games, or deck-building card games.\n\n",

    "name": "Gentes",
    "year": 2017,
    "description": "Gentes is an interesting civilization game with an innovative timing mechanism.\n\n\u0022Gentes\u0022 is a pleonasm of the Latin plural word for greater groups of human beings (e.g., tribes, nations, people; singular: \u0022gens\u0022). In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.\n\nThe game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras \u0026mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 \u0026mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:\n\n\n    Buy new cards from the common display\n    Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)\n    Train/Educate your people\n    Build/found cities\n    Take money\n\n\nTo play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training \u0026mdash; i.e., getting specific people \u0026mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people \u0026mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board \u0026mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.\n\nIt is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.\n\nTry to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III. Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols. Build cities to enlarge your options!\n\nThe differences between the Deluxified and regular edition:\n\nIncludes \u0022New Cities\u0022 Expansion\nA foil stamped box\n6 oversized meeples\n24 normal sized meeples\n89 metal coins\n28 wood action tokens\n21 wood lock tokens\n60 wood hourglass tokens\n4 dual layered player boards\n4 custom shaped score tokens\nfolded space custom insert\n1 drawstring bag\n1 upgraded round token\n\n",

    "description": "Black Rose Wars: Rebirth is a highly competitive fantasy game of combat, strategy, and deck-building set in ancient Italy. Black Rose Wars: Rebirth is the second chapter in the Black Rose Wars series. Even though 25 years have passed after the Lodge was destroyed, Mages have not forgotten the Old Ways. The Black Rose calls to them. They return to the Lodge to repair and rebuild the glory of the Black Rose who still imbues every inch of the place, to hold their tournament to name the Crown Holder of the lodge for the following century. The Black Rose demands a champion.\n\nEvery player represents a Mage in this struggle to prove themselves as the true beholder of the Black Rose\u0027s power. The mages will program spells to their board and execute them in turn order. Those spells may disable other mages spells, arm traps, arm powerful defensive moves, deal damage, or summon otherworldly beasts. The battle is played out on a hexagonal arena that requires tactics and planning to ensure each mage can pull off the perfect move. When a mage finally succumbs to their wounds, they will die and return to their room. This disrupts position and planning but no mage is ever out of the fight!\n\nBlack Rose Wars: Rebirth plays well with 1-4 players and is best played with lots of players for even more interaction. The expansions add a very large amount of options for replayability as well. This game is a stand alone game as well as an expansion for the original Black Rose Wars game.\n\n",

In that time, the cave under which it slumbered has changed greatly\u0026hellip;Goblins and strange monsters have filled its gloomy depths and there are whispers that the cave itself has begun thinking, shifting, and growing evermore dangerous.\n\nStill, stories of peril rarely overshadow the rumors of riches. And riches there may be\u0026hellip; For where a dragon slumbers, there also lies a fiercely guarded treasure. Fortunately for the slumbering beast, malevolent crystals fill the cave\u0026rsquo;s rooms with spectral light, hiding the entrance to the immeasurable treasure trove. Many have given their lives to the search and over the years the rumors have faded to legend.\n\nBut the most courageous adventurers will not be discouraged by bloodshed. On this day, a knight steps into the darkness, her gloved hand gripping the hilt of her sword. Her years of quests--all of the victories and defeats--have led to this one final adventure. Knowing the kingdom can never truly be at peace with the dragon beneath the cave, she has come to make a final stand. Little does she know that she will awake everything that slumbers in the shadows\u0026hellip; and begin the final battle in the darkness.\n\nEnter the world of Vast: The Crystal Caverns!\n\nVast takes you and your friends into the torch light of a classic cave-crawling adventure, built on the concept of total asymmetry. Gone are days of the merry band of travelers fighting off evil. In Vast, you will become part of a new legend... Any part you wish!\n\nPlay as the classic, daring Knight, the chaotic Goblin horde, the colossal, greedy Dragon, or even the Cave itself \u0026mdash; powerful, brooding, and intent on crushing the living things that dare to disturb its gloomy depths. Each role has its own powers, pieces, and paths to victory...and there can be only one winner.\n\nAs the ultimate asymmetric board game, Vast: The Crystal Caverns provides a limitless adventure, playable again and again as you and your friends explore the four different roles in different combinations. Play one-on-one in a race to the death between the Knight and the Goblins, or add in the Dragon and the Cave for deeper and more epic experiences, different every time.\n\n",

Your journey will not be safe, but you will attempt to be the richest adventurer by collecting the most precious treasures!\n\nAt the beginning of a journey, all players place their pawns within the aircraft; the players start the game with six cards in hand (or eight depending on the number of players). At the beginning of each round, one player is chosen to be the captain of the trip and he rolls 2-4 dice to discover the challenges that they will face: fog, lightning bolts, killer birds, or pirates. He must then play the appropriate cards \u0026mdash; a compass, a lightning arrester, a foghorn, or even cannons \u0026mdash; to continue on the journey and reach the next city. But before the captain plays the appropriate cards, each player must decide whether to stay within the aircraft:\n\n\n     If you exit, you\u0027re guaranteed the victory points that come from exploring the current city.\n     If you stay on board, you hope to make it to the next city in order to catch more precious treasures. If the captain can\u0027t overcome the challenge, though, everyone comes crashing down empty-handed and you\u0027ll need to begin a new trip with all passengers on board.\n\n\nDuring the journey, each adventurer can try to pull out of the game with fabulous objects (a jetpack, astronomy glasses, etc.) or by changing the trip (modifying the travel or abandoning an explorer in the city). As soon as a player earns treasure worth at least fifty points, the game ends and this player wins.\n\n",

The game uses a standard poker deck to drive an open world-style of game play, along with dry erase boards that serve as each player\u0027s map.\n\nEach turn, flip over three cards, assigning one card to represent your suit, one card to represent your value, and one card to represent your poker card. The suit dictates which of four regions you activate, the value dictates which site within that region you get to circle, and the poker card goes toward a five-card poker hand that is resolved at the end of each round. Each of the four regions \u0026mdash; Trail, Badlands, Mine, and Town \u0026mdash; offers a different puzzle to master, while each site within a region provides a unique reward such as cash, gold, helpful items like guns, horses and tools, or bonus actions to create powerful combinations.\n\nFor solo play, you can play to achieve a high score or compete against one of four \u0022cowbot\u0022 robot opponents, each with its own motivation.\n\nFor multiplayer play, players use \u0022community cards\u0022 in the center of play, with players resolving each turn simultaneously. Additionally, bounty cards add competitive goals that players are racing to achieve.\n\nIn addition to the standard game, you can play as one of 14 wild west characters.

    "description": "After one hundred years in service, the Panama Canal still is one of the most important and impressive engineering achievements in modern times.\n\nBuilt in 1914, it held a prominent role in the deployment of military vessels during WWI and in the conflicts that have followed. Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.\n\nIn the wake of the Canal\u0026rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard\u0026mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.\n\nIn Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col\u0026oacute;n Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.\n\nPanamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system\u0026mdash;\u0026ldquo;pushing\u0026rdquo;  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.\n\nOn their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies. Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing\u0026mdash;receiving a dividend each round. The questions for the players will be which companies are likely to yield higher dividends?\n\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more to explore and several ways to win, but we ask that you join us at the table and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Panama Canal with a session of Panamax!\n\n",

    "description": "\u0022The way to have Power is to take it\u0022 - William \u0022Boss\u0022 Tweed\n\nTammany Hall is a game of backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances, and taking power at all costs. If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the city\u0027s growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals, and win elections.\n\nIn Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes, and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayor\u0027s grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try to take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy.\n\nTammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization\u0027s influence spanned from its founding in the 1790s to its collapse in the 1960s, this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870 \u0026ndash; the era of Boss Tweed.\n\n",

    "description": "Hannibal \u0026 Hamilcar: Rome vs Carthage is a 20th anniversary edition of Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, an asymmetrical card-driven game for 2 players set in the time of the epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from the classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve political dominance.  The 20th Anniversary Edition includes new scenarios and variants. The original rules and components were updated and certain game mechanics have been streamlined, while producing exactly the same game results as before. The original game has been further enriched by the addition of two new expansions: Sun of Macedon and Price of Failure.\n\nHamilcar, set during the First Punic War, is a stand alone companion game sharing components and using similar mechanics but a different map. It introduces a naval system and naval battles. Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea in a conflict that will be described as a war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world\u0026rsquo;s naval power. Rome\u0027s goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage\u0027s defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula.\n\nIn both games players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.\n\n",

After you pick up your glass, the river shifts forward, revealing new pieces and new opportunities.\n\nStore the glass you pick up strategically in your shop.

Work together with your fellow farmers to save the Valley from the nefarious JojaMart Corporation! To do this, you\u0027ll need to farm, fish, friend and find all kinds of different resources to fulfill your Grandpa\u0027s Goals and restore the Community Center. Collect all kinds of items, raise animals, and explore the Mine. Gain powerful upgrades and skills and as the seasons pass see if you\u0027re able to protect the magic of Stardew Valley!\n\nThe goal of the game is to complete Grandpa\u0027s Goals and restore the Community Center, which requires you to gather different types of resources represented by tiles. You have a fixed amount of turns to accomplish this. This is driven by the Season Deck of 20 cards, one of which is drawn each turn to trigger certain events. Cooperatively the players decide each turn where they will focus their individual actions and place their pawn in that part of the Valley. Using their actions, they visit specific locations, trying to gather resources to complete their collective goals. Actions include things like: watering crops, trying to catch fish, rolling dice to explore the mines, and many more. When the Season Deck is exhausted, the game ends.\n\n",

The player who has the least negative points after this is the winner.\n\nScoring:\nNormally, negative points are same the number on the card.

    "description": "Las Vegas Royale combines the original Las Vegas dice game from 2012 with some elements of the Las Vegas Boulevard expansion from 2014.\n\nLas Vegas is an easy-to-learn, dice-rolling game that includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat in the basic game, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.\n\nEach player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked \u00221\u0022. You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the highest-valued money associated with it, then the player with the secondmost dice takes the next highest-valued money card. In case of a tie, the non-tied player with the most dice takes the highest-valued money card at that casino, while the tied players get bupkis.\n\nLas Vegas Royale includes twelve expansion tiles, and to play a more involved game, you can place an expansion tile at random by each casino. These tiles have special abilities on them, and by placing dice on them, players can activate these abilities. The expansion components also include a larger than normal die for each player that counts as two dice.\n\n",

Maybe it\u0027s the lights, maybe it\u0027s the energy, or maybe it\u0027s the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!\n\nKing of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.\n\nWhat\u0027s new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve \u0022Fame\u0022, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.\n\nThe game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.\n\nThe monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.\n\nPart of the King of Tokyo series.\n\n",

And if there ever is a place those traders love, it is the town of Dale.\n\nThere\u0026rsquo;s an extraordinary guild in the Dale founded by the greatest merchants. The tricky part is getting the membership since one must win the annual trading competition to be invited to the guild.\n\nNotable animalfolk merchants from all over the world have gathered in the town to take part in the event. Everyone has only one goal in mind \u0026ndash; to be celebrated as the winner and the newest member of the legendary guild.\n\nIn Dale of Merchants, players take the roles of those participating merchants learning new techniques, trading goods, and managing their stock. The player who first manages to complete their astounding merchant stall wins the game and gets access to the guild!\n\n",

    "description": "Letter Jam is a 2-6 player cooperative word game where players assist each other in composing meaningful words from letters around the table. The trick is holding the letter card so that it\u0026rsquo;s only visible to other players and not to you.\n\nAt the start of the game, each player receives a set of face-down letter cards that can be arranged to form an existing word. The setup can be prepared by using a special card scanning app, or by players selecting words for each other. Each player then puts their first card in their stand facing the other players without looking at it, and the game begins.\n\nThe game is played in turns. Each turn, players simultaneously search other players\u0026rsquo; letters to see what words they can spell out (telling the others the length of the word they can make up). The player who offers the longest word can then be chosen as the clue giver.\n\nThe clue giver spells out their clue by putting numbered tokens in front of the other players. Number one goes to the player whose letter comes first in the clue, number two to the second letter etc. They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents.\n\nEach player with a numbered token (or tokens) in front of them then tries to figure out what their letter is. If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter.  At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word. All players then reveal their cards to see if they were successful or not. The more players who have an existing word in front of them, the bigger their collective success.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "The woods are old-growth, dappled with sunlight. Delicious mushrooms beckon from every grove and hollow. Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it\u0027s your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you\u0027re hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you saut\u0026eacute; them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest.\n\nMorels, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms \u0026ndash; sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough \u0026ndash; earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.\n\nFollowing each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead.\n\n",

Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it\u0027s to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.\n\nOn a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that\u0027s the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you\u0027re the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.\n\nWhen either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.\n\n",

The choice to concentrate on varying gameplay strategies and goals, such as musical performances, instrument building and repairs, apprentice training and workshop expansion, and overall reputation as an instrument maker, provide multiple paths to victory.\n\nLuthier finds true harmony through an authentic and original marriage of theme and mechanisms, resulting in a rich gameplay experience that equally speaks to both the strategic gamer and the classical music lover.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to the Northern Expanse, a place where nature is still unexplored, mystical and dangerous. When the humans first arrived, they thought they found an unspoiled paradise, filled with bountiful forests, lakes swimming with fish and cold freshwater flowing from the mountains. But as their settlements expanded and the surrounding forests grew thinner, nature itself pushed back. Great creatures known as Beasts emerged, and with their fangs, claws and mystical powers, they proved an incredible threat to the humans. In order to protect the settlements, humans enlisted specialised hunters, tasked with tracking and killing the Beasts before too many of their kin perish.\n\nThe Beast uses a deck of direction cards to move over forests, swamps and caverns, using guile and deceit to hide its track from the hunters. However, whenever a hunter moves over a location where the Beast has previously been, a trail appears. Only when a hunter searches a location or the Beast itself attacks an unsuspecting target is the Beast\u0027s actual position revealed. More so, each hunter has but one chance of searching each round, making it a tense and difficult decision. Hunters seldom have full information whether the trail they\u0026rsquo;re pursuing contains the Beast\u0026rsquo;s actual location, or if the trail has already gone cold.\n\nEach action you perform in this game is done by playing a card from your hand (up to a maximum of two cards per turn). This means that if a player wants to search, attack or move, they need to have a card in their hand that lets them do that. Before each round, both hunters and Beast participate in a draft for the most important cards. All action cards can be used by both Beast and hunters alike.\n\nIn order to win this game, you either need to cooperate every step of the way if you play as a hunter, or skillfully outmaneuver your opponents if you play as Beast. On their own, hunters are never stronger than the Beast. Only when hunters communicate, strategize and combine their actions can they bring down the Beast before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the designer\n\n",

    "description": "Welcome to Arzium, land of ancient civilizations, bizarre creatures, unexplained wonders, and vibrant characters.\n\nA great sleeping sickness has spread across the land, sending every type of creature to roam for hundreds of miles in a dazed, incoherent march. It\u0027s your job to seek them out and wake them from their sleepwalk, recruiting them to help you find even more lost souls!\n\nIn Roam, you and up to three friends compete to find lost adventurers. The game includes more than fifty unique, tarot-sized adventurer cards, which feature characters from Near and Far, Above and Below, and Islebound. The opposite side of each card depicts a landscape split into six squares, and two rows of three of these cards are placed in the center of the playing area to make the board.\n\nEach turn, you may activate one of the adventurer cards in your party by flipping the card face down. Activating an adventurer allows you to place search tokens on the board in the shape depicted on your adventurer card. When every square on a landscape card has been searched, the player who did the most claims the card, finding the lost adventurer and adding them to their party. Each adventurer you add to your party gives you points and a new search pattern that you can use.\n\nWhen searching, you also claim coins, which can be spent to use special actions or purchase artifacts with useful powers. When one player has ten adventurers in their party, the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n",

    "description": "Cerebria is a dynamic, team-based, objective-driven area control game, where players play as Spirits, powerful entities representing Bliss or Gloom. These opposing forces - the two sides of human nature - struggle to control and shape the Inside World, the metaphorical representation of an evolving personality.\n Cerebria introduces a unique theme and numerous innovative mechanisms. The game is centered around the player-controlled Spirits, and the Emotion cards controlling Cerebria\u0026rsquo;s areas, each with their own stats and abilities.\n\nThe Spirits can perform up to three actions on their turn. These include moving between Cerebria\u0026rsquo;s Realms and Frontiers, using the specific powers of the Realms, invoking and upgrading Emotion cards, removing opposing Emotions, and building Fortresses to consolidate their influence on certain areas. The Actions cost Willpower, gained primarily by absorbing from the Origin\u0026rsquo;s Spheres in the middle of the board. Both Bliss and Gloom also have a rare shared team resource, Ambition, enabling them to use the game\u0026rsquo;s most powerful effects.\n The teams can score points either by accomplishing publicly known minor objectives (the Intentions), or completing their major objectives (the Aspirations), which change dynamically during the course of the game. Scoring Aspirations allows players to add Bliss and Gloom Fragments to the Identity, built in the middle of the board. These are key moments in the game: Cerebria\u0026rsquo;s state is in constant flux, but the Fragments are permanent imprints of a game state during the scoring events.\n The game is won by the side with more influence over the finished Identity, thus becoming the dominant force in Cerebria.\n\n",

Selecting the same cards as the other players allows you to score more points. Conversely, selecting a card that no one else chooses may cost you dearly.\n\nAt the end of the fourth round, each player calculates their total score.

The players are traders in this day, competing to be the first to earn 60 gold by buying and selling tea, hide, fruits, salt, silk, and trinkets.  The game is played with cards that allow players to buy and sell goods, help you or hinder your opponent, and others that add a bit of spice to the game.  Return to the dark continent where the players alternate turns with up to 5 actions each until one player reaches the goal and wins the game.\u0022\n\nOriginal description from Games4You.\n\nPlayers take on the role of merchants offering their wares from market stands. On a player\u0027s turn, he has five actions to choose from. Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards, and activate buildup cards.\n\nIn order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.\n\nBy owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents\u0027 plans.\n\nThe first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.\n\nThe game\u0027s attraction lies with the many special cards. Many different combinations are possible during the game, and each game plays out differently as a result.\n\n",

The game lasts three rounds, with players scoring at the end of each round, in addition to bonus scoring at the end of the game.\n\nAt the start of a round, each player receives a hand of ten cards. Each player chooses two cards, then passes the remaining cards to the left. All players reveal their cards at the same time, then decide whether to use 0, 1, or 2 of them in personal rows of cards. When you start a row, you can use any card; to add a card to an existing row, that card must be higher than the row\u0027s highest card or lower than the lowest one. A player can have at most three rows of cards. Discard any cards you don\u0027t use.\n\nPlayers repeat this drafting, passing, and playing process until they have played ten cards. The first round ends, and players now receive 3 points for each blue card in their rows.\n\nPlayers then receive a new hand of ten cards to start round 2, once again choosing two cards and passing the rest, but now to the right. Players continue building on the rows that they already have, scoring 3 points for each blue card and 4 points for each green card at the end of round two.\n\nFor round three, players have ten more cards and pass cards to the left once again. At the end of this round, players once again score for their blue and green cards, while also receiving 7 points for each gray card in their rows. Additionally, each player scores for their pink cherry blossom cards, with these cards having a pyramidal scoring structure: one card = 1 point, two cards = 3, three cards = 6, etc. Whoever has the highest total score wins!\n\n",

    "description": "A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover. One of Kruger\u0026rsquo;s last veteran NCO\u0026rsquo;s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man\u0026rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen\u0026mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters\u0026mdash;all thoughts of the advance abandoned with the sudden demise of their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger\u0026rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat or been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient to their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes with the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong.\n\nThis is Squad Leader, a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. You make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army. You direct the fire of your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armor assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone.\n\nSquad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armored warfare games. Squad Leader provides rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.\n\nSquad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows your own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a \u0026ldquo;Design Your Own\u0026rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.\n\nEach hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters of real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles or 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.\n\nSquad Leader is not an easy game. Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience. Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H. Complexity scale.\n\n",

    "description": "Jekyll vs. Hyde is a trick-taking game for two players based on the famous novella Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. As Dr. Jekyll, you\u0027ll need to resist Mr. Hyde\u0027s fierce attacks to protect your mind and keep the secret of your dual nature. As Mr. Hyde, your goal is to dominate Dr. Jekyll to overcome his identity.\n\nOne player is Dr. Jekyll ; the other is Mr. Hyde. The game plays in three rounds. At the end of each round, Dr. Jekyll\u0027s identity will progressively disappear under Mr. Hyde\u0027s relentless attacks.  Compare the number of tricks that each player has won in this round and subtract the lowest score from the highest one (for instance, if Dr. Jekyll won 6 tricks and Mr. Hyde won 4 tricks, then the final result is 6-4=2). This result indicates by how many spaces the Identity Marker will move to Mr. Hyde\u0027s side.\n\nEvil is relentless! Even if Dr. Jekyll won more tricks that Mr. Hyde, the marker will progress towards Mr. Hyde\u0027s side. As Dr. Jekyll, your goal is to keep balance, without giving in to darkness!\n\nIf the marker reaches the last space of the track (far left), then Mr. Hyde instantly wins the game. Otherwise, start a new round: remove the three colored tokens from the board and reshuffle all cards, including the 5 cards that you set aside at the beginning of this round.\n\nMr. Hyde wins as soon as the Identity Marker reaches the last space of the Identity Track (far left). If the marker did not reach the end of the track after three rounds, then Dr. Jekyll wins, escaping from Mr. Hyde\u0027s dark influence.\n\n",

Throughout the game you acquire victory points through a variety of means \u0026mdash; and possibly a few visitor deaths as a natural consequence of overly enthusiastic dinosaur encounters. At the end of the game, you lose points if you accumulated too many deaths, then the player with the most points wins!\n\n",

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.\n\nThe tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the \u0022Ace\u0022 of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think \u0022White dragon in a snowstorm\u0022), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.\n\nFour players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players\u0027 discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one\u0027s left, by calling \u0022Chow\u0022), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling \u0022Pung\u0022), pairs, and other patterns. \u0022Pung\u0022 takes precedence over \u0022Chow\u0022, and \u0022Mah Jongg\u0022 takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw \u0022Chow\u0022 out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players \u0022Mah Jongg\u0022? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.\n\nOriginating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.  Although the rules for game play are fairly constant, there are an immense variety of scoring schemes.  A few general categories of rule-sets include:  Chinese Classical, Hong Kong Old Style, Japanese, Taiwanese, Western, and American.\n\n",

    "description": "Coffee Roaster is a solitaire pool-building game. You choose a variety of coffee beans you want to roast, and put a number of tokens specific to that variety into a bag. Each turn, you draw a number of bean tokens randomly from the bag to advance their roast level. When you are finished, you make a cup-testing to check the taste of your coffee and score points accordingly. Each variety has its own target roast level, but approaching the target is not enough for perfect roasting; you also have to even out the roast level of each bean, while not spoiling the flavor of that variety.\n\nYou also have to screen out smoke tokens and burnt bean tokens that hinder your roasting, and reject bean tokens that spoil the taste. It is important to control the contents of your bag utilizing flavor effects and unique effects caused by placing tokens on the roast board.\n\nThere are 22 varieties of beans in the game. In one game, you try to roast three of them, and your roaster title is awarded based on the total score. Enjoy the world of coffee-roasting, and aim for the ultimate title \u0022Meister\u0022.\n\n\u0026bull;\u0026bull;\u0026bull;\n\n\u300CCOFFEE ROASTER\u300D\u306F\uFF11\u4EBA\u7528\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30BF\u30FC\u30F3\u3054\u3068\u306B\u888B\u306E\u4E2D\u306B\u5165\u308C\u305F\u898F\u5B9A\u6570\u306E\u8C46\u30C8\u30FC\u30AF\u30F3\u306E\u7119\u714E\u5EA6\u3092\u4E0A\u6607\u3055\u305B\u3066\u3044\u304D\u3001\u6700\u5F8C\u306E\u30AB\u30C3\u30D7\u30C6\u30B9\u30C8\u3067\u5473\u3092\u78BA\u304B\u3081\u5F97\u70B9\u3092\u8A08\u7B97\u3057\u307E\u3059\u3002\u304A\u3044\u3057\u3044\u7119\u714E\u30B3\u30FC\u30D2\u30FC\u306B\u3059\u308B\u305F\u3081\u306B\u306F\u3001\u72D9\u3063\u305F\u7119\u714E\u5EA6\u306B\u8FD1\u3065\u3051\u308B\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306A\u304F\u3001\u8C46\u306E\u714E\u308A\u5177\u5408\u3092\u63C3\u3048\u305F\u308A\u3001\u7279\u5FB4\u3092\u91B8\u3057\u51FA\u3059\u30D5\u30EC\u30FC\u30D0\u30FC\u3092\u6B8B\u3057\u305F\u308A\u3059\u308B\u5FC5\u8981\u304C\u3042\u308A\u307E\u3059\u3002\n\u59A8\u3052\u3068\u306A\u308B\u7159\u30C1\u30C3\u30D7\u3084\u7126\u3052\u8C46\u30C1\u30C3\u30D7\u3001\u307E\u305F\u5473\u3092\u640D\u306A\u3046\u6B20\u70B9\u8C46\u30C1\u30C3\u30D7\u306E\u6392\u9664\u306B\u3082\u6C17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u307E\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\u30D5\u30EC\u30FC\u30D0\u30FC\u52B9\u679C\u3084\u7119\u714E\u30DC\u30FC\u30C9\u3078\u30C1\u30C3\u30D7\u3092\u914D\u7F6E\u3059\u308B\u3053\u3068\u3067\u5F97\u308B\u7279\u6B8A\u52B9\u679C\u3092\u99C6\u4F7F\u3057\u3066\u3001\u888B\u306E\u4E2D\u306E\u72B6\u614B\u3092\u3046\u307E\u304F\u30B3\u30F3\u30C8\u30ED\u30FC\u30EB\u3059\u308B\u3053\u3068\u304C\u91CD\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u767B\u5834\u3059\u308B\u8C46\u306F\uFF12\uFF12\u7A2E\u985E\u3002\u305D\u306E\u3046\u3061\uFF13\u3064\u306E\u8C46\u306E\u7119\u714E\u306B\u6311\u6226\u3057\u305F\u5408\u8A08\u5024\u304C\u7119\u714E\u8077\u4EBA\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306E\u3042\u306A\u305F\u306E\u30E9\u30F3\u30AF\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6700\u9AD8\u4F4D\u30DE\u30A4\u30B9\u30BF\u30FC\u306E\u79F0\u53F7\u3092\u52DD\u3061\u53D6\u308B\u3079\u304F\u3001\u7119\u714E\u306E\u4E16\u754C\u3092\u5B58\u5206\u306B\u697D\u3057\u3093\u3067\u304F\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\n\n",

    "description": "Humanity, through its irresponsible behavior, has exhausted the natural resources of Earth, making it almost uninhabitable. In a burst of lucidity, pressed by the irreversible degradation of your planet, the great nations are forced to put aside their differences and share their knowledge in order to create the most vast spacecraft ever constructed. The Black Angel, the first intergalactic frigate in history, must transport the genetic heritage of humanity beyond known worlds, over a journey that is likely to last several thousand years. Her crew will be composed of only robots. Because no nation is willing to trust creation of the AI (artificial intelligence) that will control this crew to any other nation, a compromise is found: The Black Angel will be co-managed by several AIs, and the utility of each decision will be evaluated in VP (Validation Process).\n\nPlayers take the role of AI robots, piloting the Black Angel while engaging with alien species and fighting off ravagers.  Actions are determined by cards and die rolls.  Rounds continue until either of the following situations occurs: The Black Angel figurine arrives on Spes (during a Sequence B) or The Ravager card deck becomes empty (during a Sequence A). Players finish the round in progress, and then play one final round.\n\nAt the end of the final round, victory points are tallied (depending on the end condition) and the player with the most victory points wins.\n\n",

    "description": "Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak takes the players to an indoor environment with vicious close-ranged fights, Prison Outbreak contains all the needed material for a new player to enter the Zombicide universe, and lots of content, almost all new, for an existing Zombicide player to expand their game experience. In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!\n\nThe Prison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies. They\u0026rsquo;re really tied to each other. Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons. You have to think fast, foresee the improbable and jump into melee at every turn. This is like a modern dungeon where levers are replaced with switches to open or lock doors, use security rooms and reach secret areas.\n\nPrison Outbreak also contains six new survivors with their Zombivor aspects. These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other. They\u0026rsquo;re precious assets to any Zombicide team.\n\nMissions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter. Many challenges await them, but they have new tools of the trade: riot shields, automatic shotguns, concrete saws and many more toys. There\u0026rsquo;s even an alternate ending.\n\n",
