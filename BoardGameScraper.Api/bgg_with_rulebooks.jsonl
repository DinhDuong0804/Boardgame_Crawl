{"bgg_id":224517,"name":"Brass: Birmingham","year":2018,"description":"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace\u0027s 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution between the years of 1770 and 1870.\n\nIt offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build and establish your industries and network in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.\n\nEach round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):\n\n1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.\n2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.\n3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.\n4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.\n5) Loan - Take a \u0026pound;30 loan and reduce your income.\n\nBrass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:\n\n6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":856856,"rank":1,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__small/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg"],"designer":["Gavan Brown:32887","Matt Tolman:32943","Martin Wallace:6"],"artist":["Gavan Brown:32887","Lina Cossette:70571","David Forest:70568","Gui Landgraf:140907","Damien Mammoliti:38179","Matt Tolman:32943"],"publisher":["Roxley:21765","Arclight Games:3475","Board Game Rookie:44580","BoardM Factory:25074","CMON Global Limited:21608","Conclave Editora:11043","CoolPlay:50696","CrowD Games:34522","Dexker Games:31071","Funforge:8832","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Ghenos Games:4785","Giant Roc:42147","Lanlalen:36210","Lord of Boards:46500","Maldito Games:30677","PHALANX:36186","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","TLAMA games:41423","White Goblin Games:4932","\u76D2\u62CD\u5DE5\u4F5C\u5BA4 Hepa Studio:54777"],"category":["Age of Reason:2726","Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Post-Napoleonic:2710","Trains:1034","Transportation:1011"],"mechanic":["Chaining:2956","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Income:2902","Loans:2904","Market:2900","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Network and Route Building:2081","Ownership:2911","Tags:3100","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:28.8874682Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/214238/reference-sheet-for-brass-birmingham-english","title":"Reference sheet for Brass: Birmingham (English)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/179512/universal-head-esoteric-order-of-gamers-brass-birm","title":"Universal Head / Esoteric Order of Gamers BRASS: BIRMINGHAM Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/249617/teaching-outline-and-rules-reference-for-brass-bir","title":"Teaching Outline and Rules Reference for Brass: Birmingham","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/261380/teaching-guide-and-faq","title":"Teaching Guide and FAQ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/174763/brass-birmingham-reference-sheet-and-context-notes","title":"Brass: Birmingham reference sheet (and context notes)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/181638/brass-birmingham-rules-summary","title":"Brass: Birmingham rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/245580/reference-sheets-for-brass-birmingham-english","title":"Reference Sheets for Brass Birmingham (English)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

{"bgg_id":161936,"name":"Pandemic Legacy: Season 1","year":2015,"description":"Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts in a very similar fashion as basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hot spots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nDuring a player\u0027s turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.\n\nAfter a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.\n\nEach month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month\u0027s objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.\n\nDuring the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it\u0027s no longer available for play.\n\nPart of the Pandemic series\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":85056,"rank":3,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__original/img/PlzAH7swN1nsFxOXbfUvE3TkE5w=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2452831.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__small/img/NQQcjS31TO0DE246N9rpt0hd9eo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2452831.png"],"designer":["Rob Daviau:442","Matt Leacock:378"],"artist":["Chris Quilliams:14057"],"publisher":["Z-Man Games:538","Asterion Press:15889","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby Japan:1391","Jolly Thinkers:15983","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lacerta:5812","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd:9325","MINDOK:7992","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Environmental:1084","Medical:2145"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Cooperative Game:2023","Hand Management:2040","Legacy Game:2824","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Point to Point Movement:2078","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Set Collection:2004","Tags:3100","Trading:2008","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:28.8930738Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/123531/pandemic-legacy-rules-english-no-spoilers","title":"Pandemic Legacy rules - English - no spoilers","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/209910/pandemic-legacy-season-1-turkish-rule-book-startin","title":"Pandemic Legacy Season 1 Turkish Rule Book (Starting)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":174430,"name":"Gloomhaven","year":2017,"description":"Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the roles of wandering adventurers with their own special sets of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.\n This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions about what to do next, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \u0026ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure\u0026rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a co-operative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.\n\nEach turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player\u0026rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end u exhausted and be forced to retreat.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":854715,"rank":4,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__original/img/7d-lj5Gd1e8PFnD97LYFah2c45M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2437871.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__small/img/veqFeP4d_3zNhFc3GNBkV95rBEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2437871.jpg"],"designer":["Isaac Childres:69802"],"artist":["Alexandr Elichev:77084","Josh T.

{"bgg_id":316554,"name":"Dune: Imperium","year":2020,"description":"Dune: Imperium is a game that uses deck building to add a hidden information angle to traditional worker placement. It finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.\n\nAs a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal your forces and spies. War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis \u0026ndash; Dune, the desert planet.\n\nYou start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents.  As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.\n\nUnlike many deck building games, you don\u0026rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it\u0026rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you\u0026rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round\u0026rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.\n\nDefeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards. The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!\n\nSome important links: The Official FAQ, the Unofficial FAQ, and an Automa (solo and 2p) Overview\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":841474,"rank":5,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PhjygpWSo-0labGrPBMyyg__original/img/mZzaBAEEJpMlHWWmC0R6Su0OibQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5666597.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PhjygpWSo-0labGrPBMyyg__small/img/JGgY-nBmkyB8WRp8vcoBLlNMQ5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5666597.jpg"],"designer":["Paul Dennen:92370"],"artist":["Clay Brooks:119957","Brett Nienburg:155730","Raul Ramos:73773","Nate Storm:31001"],"publisher":["Dire Wolf:33706","Arclight Games:3475","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Geekach LLC:58739","Lavka Games:34801","Lucky Duck Games:33626","MIPL:51614","Reflexshop:36563","REXhry:21053","sternenschimmermeer:39249","Tabletop KZ:55404","YingDi (\u65C5\u6CD5\u5E08\u8425\u5730):48648"],"category":["Movies / TV / Radio theme:1064","Novel-based:1093","Political:1001","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Card Play Conflict Resolution:2857","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Delayed Purchase:2901","Force Commitment:2864","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Open Drafting:2041","Ownership:2911","Race:2876","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tags:3100","Take That:2686","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Variable Player Powers:2015","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:28.8931598Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/210689/dune-imperium-rulebook-and-supplements","title":"Dune: Imperium Rulebook and Supplements","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/227663/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-dune-imperium-rules-a","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers DUNE: IMPERIUM Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/210720/dune-imperium-player-reference","title":"Dune: Imperium Player Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/213648/dune-imperium-guide-3-pages","title":"Dune: Imperium Guide - 3 pages","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/235259/strategy-guide-for-new-players-dune-imperium","title":"Strategy Guide for New Players - DUNE IMPERIUM","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/300224/dune-imperium-rules-overview-in-a-wink","title":"Dune Imperium rules overview in a Wink","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/276488/skirmish-rules-and-cards","title":"Skirmish Rules and Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":233078,"name":"Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition","year":2017,"description":"Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players each take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.\n\nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed from among 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.\n\nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these strategies are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empires, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.\n\nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them over the course of the game. Each player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, achievement of which provides victory points--only for the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor\u0027s home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective.

{"bgg_id":115746,"name":"War of the Ring: Second Edition","year":2011,"description":"In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP) while the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions before they start to fight in earnest: this is represented by the Political Track which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.\n\nThe game can be won by a military victory if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ring bearer: while the armies clash across Middle-earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle-earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ring bearer from harm with an attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow so that they do not overrun Middle-earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can perform during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies or characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":150,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":8553,"rank":8,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ImPgGag98W6gpV1KV812aA__original/img/38jB7fN07DwlrGKYAf-J0vsNdgs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1215633.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ImPgGag98W6gpV1KV812aA__small/img/X-lBBdG4uO6LT0y1vXxCN4jdR4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1215633.jpg"],"designer":["Roberto Di Meglio:3247","Marco Maggi:934","Francesco Nepitello:935"],"artist":["John Howe:11884","Fabio Maiorana:20670"],"publisher":["Ares Games:17917","Angry Lion Games:38809","Devir:2366","GaGa Games:29194","Galakta:4617","Geekach LLC:58739","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Nuts!

{"bgg_id":167791,"name":"Terraforming Mars","year":2016,"description":"In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.\n\nAs a player, you acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to your hand. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards and actually playing them. Standard Projects are always available to complement your hand of cards. Your basic income, as well as your basic score, are based on your Terraform Rating. However, your income is boosted by your production, and VPs are also gained from many other sources.\n\nYou keep track of your production and resources on your player board.  The game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation and consists of the following phases:\n\n1) Player order shifts clockwise.\n2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.\n3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.\n4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.\n\nWhen the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their required levels, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Combine your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":834053,"rank":9,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wg9oOLcsKvDesSUdZQ4rxw__original/img/thIqWDnH9utKuoKVEUqveDixprI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3536616.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wg9oOLcsKvDesSUdZQ4rxw__small/img/BTxqxgYay5tHJfVoJ2NF5g43_gA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3536616.jpg"],"designer":["Jacob Fryxelius:52075"],"artist":["Isaac Fryxelius:62819","Daniel Fryxelius:52076"],"publisher":["FryxGames:18575","Arclight Games:3475","Br\u00E4dspel.se:46980","Fantasmagoria:22560","Ghenos Games:4785","Golden Egg Games:22763","Green Elephant Games:46884","Intrafin Games:5380","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Kilogames:32866","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lavka Games:34801","Lex Games:25203","Maldito Games:30677","MeepleBR:32591","MINDOK:7992","MIPL:51614","MYBG Co., Ltd.:23756","NeoTroy Games:32395","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Reflexshop:36563","Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844","Siam Board Games:33998","Stronghold Games:11652","SuperHeated Neurons:48279","Surfin\u0027 Meeple China:36763"],"category":["Civilization:1015","Economic:1021","Environmental:1084","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Closed Drafting:2984","Contracts:2912","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Hexagon Grid:2026","Income:2902","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tags:3100","Take That:2686","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:28.8932931Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/137647/humanitys-quick-start-guide-to-terraforming-mars","title":"Humanity\u0027s Quick Start Guide to Terraforming Mars","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135533/final-english-rules","title":"Final English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/138220/single-sheet-rules-summary","title":"Single Sheet Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/165349/terraforming-mars-plus-expansions-symbol-and-play","title":"Terraforming Mars \u002B Expansions Symbol and Play Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/199985/comprehensive-faq-and-card-clarification-reference","title":"Comprehensive FAQ and Card Clarification Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150779/solo-variant","title":"Solo variant  ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/137795/tm-tag-count-and-function-reference","title":"TM tag count and function reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150111/terraforming-mars-player-aid-and-reference-sheet","title":"Terraforming Mars - Player Aid \u0026 Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/224599/terraforming-mars-consolidated-rules","title":"Terraforming Mars Consolidated rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/152414/terraforming-mars-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Terraforming Mars - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/170111/pdf-of-the-official-faqrules-clarification-as-of-2","title":"PDF of the official FAQ/Rules clarification as of 20181001","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":187645,"name":"Star Wars: Rebellion","year":2016,"description":"Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.\n\nExperience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you\u0027ll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:\n\n     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.\n     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you\u0027ll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you\u0027ll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you\u0027ll need to sway the galaxy\u0027s citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.\n\n\nFeaturing more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy\u0027s most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.\n\nYet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":180,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":842114,"rank":10,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7SrPNGBKg9IIsP4UQpOi8g__original/img/GKueTbkCk2Ramf6ai8mDj-BP6cI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4325841.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7SrPNGBKg9IIsP4UQpOi8g__small/img/gAxzddRVQiRdjZHYFUZ2xc5Jlbw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4325841.jpg"],"designer":["Corey Konieczka:6651"],"artist":["Matt Allsopp:34719","David Ardila:32122","Balaskas:20067","Tiziano Baracchi:19822","Ryan Barger:12438","Jorge Barrero:81542","Cassandre Bolan:86044","Jon Bosco:63040","Matt Bradbury:21426","Adam Burn:46414","Alexandre Dainche:29808","Christina Davis:69244","Anthony Devine:75483","Allen Douglas:17275","Jose Mikhail Elloso:90475","Tony Foti:43532","Michele Frigo:86045","Mariusz Gandzel:18700","Zach Graves:21095","Richard Hanuschek:86222","Andrew Johanson:17704","Jeff Lee Johnson:38000","Jason Juta:14590","Adam Lane:46416","Ignacio Baz\u00E1n Lazcano:46353","Ralph McQuarrie:13442","Mark Molnar:44813","Jake Murray:41638","Ameen Naksewee:59149","David Auden Nash:49382","Mike Nash:19549","Maciej Rebisz:48661","Alexandru Sabo:49381","Tony Shasteen:14318","Stephen Somers:77085","Matthew Starbuck:41678","Nicholas Stohlman:41679","Angela Sung:49393","Darren Tan:69091","Ryan Valle:68942","Jose Vega:77254","VIKO:90477","Magali Villeneuve:29809","Jacob Walker:12627","Ben Zweifel:49280"],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Asterion Press:15889","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Edge Entertainment:2973","Galakta:4617","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Geekach LLC:58739","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby World:18852","Korea Boardgames:8291"],"category":["Civil War:1102","Movies / TV / Radio theme:1064","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Area Movement:2046","Card Play Conflict Resolution:2857","Contracts:2912","Delayed Purchase:2901","Dice Rolling:2072","Die Icon Resolution:2856","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040","Hidden Movement:2967","Income:2902","Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846","Tags:3100","Take That:2686","Team-Based Game:2019","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:28.8933781Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131747/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-star-wars-rebellion-r","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers STAR WARS: REBELLION Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/142397/bmv-battle-mat-and-board-for-star-wars-rebellion-a","title":"BMV Battle Mat and Board for Star Wars: Rebellion and Expansion","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/130954/quick-reference-and-player-aid","title":"Quick Reference and Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/130930/single-page-detailed-player-and-setup-reference","title":"Single Page - Detailed Player \u0026 Setup Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167375/enhanced-battle-mat-with-quick-reference-cards-for","title":"Enhanced Battle Mat with Quick Reference Cards for Star Wars Rebellion and Rise of the Empire Expansion","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/151912/rebellion-missions-actions-and-objectives-rote","title":"Rebellion Missions, Actions \u0026 Objectives RotE","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131480/mission-reference-sheet","title":"Mission Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/215149/revised-solo-reference-sheet","title":"Revised Solo Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/162019/rebellion-battle-mat-with-references-expansion-com","title":"Rebellion Battle Mat with references (Expansion Compatible)","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132372/ffg-star-wars-rebellion-action-card-gaming-aidrefe","title":"FFG Star Wars Rebellion Action Card Gaming Aid/Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":162886,"name":"Spirit Island","year":2017,"description":"In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\n\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic co-operative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit\u0027s elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek new power, or to spread their presence into new areas of the island.\n\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming towns and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you\u0027d hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them, for example, to drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\n\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last explorer, town and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they\u0027ll run away even if explorers or even towns and cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\n\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg., a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":834069,"rank":11,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjCm4ZvPjIZxS-mYgSPy1g__original/img/9uLd9C3XAvInLCLhAoXqKVk56zs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7013651.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjCm4ZvPjIZxS-mYgSPy1g__small/img/aUlIih2_R7P8IYKeyNl2heLQbu8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7013651.jpg"],"designer":["R.

In addition, Gaia planets can be used by all factions for colonization, and Transdimensional planets can be changed into Gaia planets.\n\nAll factions can improve their skills in six different areas of development: Terraforming, Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, Gaiaforming, Economy, Research; leading to advanced technology and special bonuses. To do all of that, each group has special skills and abilities.\n\nThe playing area is made of ten sectors, allowing a variable set-up and thus an even bigger replay value than its predecessor Terra Mystica.

{"bgg_id":12333,"name":"Twilight Struggle","year":2005,"description":"Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are \u0026ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle. \u0026ndash; John F. Kennedy\n\nIn 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler\u0027s war machine, while humanity\u0027s most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors.\n\nTwilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new \u0022superpowers\u0022 scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.\n\nTwilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT\u0027s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one\u0027s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Event cards add detail and flavor to the game.

{"bgg_id":84876,"name":"The Castles of Burgundy","year":2011,"description":"The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers. The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.\n\nThe game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.\n\nDuring each round, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:\n\n    take a settlement tile and place it in the staging area on their player board\n    take a settlement tile from the staging area and place in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, \n    deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice\n    take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.  \n\n\nIn addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile and place it in the staging area on their player board.\n\nThe game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins.\n\nThe rules include basic and advanced versions.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":81565,"rank":15,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sH2YTQ10dHj1ibfS-KKtGA__original/img/L_gsMsuhbAe0kyq1QLAmyeKOeSs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8745814.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sH2YTQ10dHj1ibfS-KKtGA__small/img/f5zFXdTcH9RNY0iMNBppd8D-_r0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8745814.jpg"],"designer":["Stefan Feld:4958"],"artist":["Julien Delval:11886","Harald Lieske:4959"],"publisher":["alea:9","Ravensburger:34","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Giochi Uniti:5530","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos:858","Hobby World:18852","Maldito Games:30677","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"],"category":["Animals:1089","Dice:1017","Medieval:1035","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Delayed Purchase:2901","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Grid Coverage:2978","Hexagon Grid:2026","Open Drafting:2041","Pattern Building:2048","Tile Placement:2002","Track Movement:2939","Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:28.8935689Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/67400/the-castles-of-burgundy-essential-rules-and-tile-r","title":"The Castles of Burgundy - Essential rules and tile reference (EN)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66349/the-castles-of-burgundy-quick-reference","title":"The Castles of Burgundy Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/208323/action-andy-castles-of-burgundy-and-all-promos-com","title":"ACTION ANDY - Castles Of Burgundy and all Promos Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/114373/cob-base-game-tile-cheat-sheet","title":"CoB Base Game - Tile Cheat Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/130982/the-castles-of-burgundy-reference","title":"The Castles of Burgundy - Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/100135/castles-of-burgundy-simple-cheat-sheet","title":"Castles of Burgundy simple cheat sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/75138/teaching-guide-for-die-burgen-from-the-how-to-play","title":"Teaching Guide for Die Burgen from \u0022The How to Play Podcast\u0022","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/87960/castles-of-burgundy-rules-summary","title":"Castles of Burgundy rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/173945/castles-of-burgundy-expansion-rules-compilation","title":"Castles of Burgundy - Expansion Rules Compilation","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135237/the-castles-of-burgundy-detailed-summary-of-rules","title":"The Castles of Burgundy - Detailed Summary of Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/152592/the-castles-of-burgundy-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"The Castles of Burgundy - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/106878/rule-summary-sheet-for-players","title":"Rule summary sheet for players","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/141445/the-castles-of-burgundy-quick-reference-card-qrc","title":"The Castles of Burgundy - Quick Reference Card (QRC)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/156321/rules-for-expansion-tiles-and-cards","title":"Rules for Expansion Tiles and Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/217526/the-castles-of-burgundy-quick-graphical-tiles-refe","title":"The Castles of Burgundy  Quick Graphical Tiles Reference","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}]}
{"bgg_id":182028,"name":"Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization","year":2015,"description":"Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game\u0027s cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.\n\nThrough the Ages (TTA) is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, and by: discovering new technologies, electing competent leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages, beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is \u0027built\u0027 in the same manner as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with a stronger military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a strong military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":825396,"rank":16,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fVwPntkJKgaEo0rIC0RwpA__original/img/1jawNpljTXwnT4km_2CjGwoUPR8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2663291.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fVwPntkJKgaEo0rIC0RwpA__small/img/31usGlzlBReEFf60bcgbvDTjwCg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2663291.jpg"],"designer":["Vlaada Chv\u00E1til:789"],"artist":["Filip Murmak:114458","Radim Pech:11938","Jakub Politzer:94497","Milan Vavro\u0148:11961"],"publisher":["Czech Games Edition:7345","Cranio Creations:10768","Devir:2366","DiceTree Games:23205","Eagle-Gryphon Games:597","Feelindigo:36981","GaGa Games:29194","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","HaKubia:23382","HeidelB\u00C4R Games:38505","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","IELLO:8923","MINDOK:7992","New Games Order, LLC:9881","One Moment Games:30552","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Civilization:1015","Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Auction / Bidding:2012","Auction: Dutch:2924","Events:2850","Income:2902","Open Drafting:2041","Player Elimination:2685","Tags:3100","Take That:2686"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:28.8935998Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/123302/tta-a-new-story-of-civilization-card-reference","title":"TtA: A New Story of Civilization Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/128311/through-the-ages-new-story-solopractice-game-rules","title":"Through the Ages New Story Solo/Practice game rules v1.0","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/153085/automa-variant","title":"Automa variant","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/241541/summary-of-the-easy-to-forget-rules-and-setup","title":"Summary of the easy-to-forget rules \u0026 setup","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/124457/through-the-ages-card-conversion-guide","title":"Through the Ages Card Conversion Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/145132/through-the-ages-a-new-story-of-civilization-offic","title":"Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization Official Expansion Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"docx"}]}

The game draws inspiration from current or emerging technologies and efforts in space exploration.Players will explore nearby planets and their moons by launching probes from Earth while taking advantage of ever-shifting planetary positions. Decide whether to land on their surface to collect valuable samples, or stay in orbit for a broader survey. Additionally, by directing your telescopes to gaze into distant star systems, you may detect traces of alien signals or undiscovered exoplanets, and collect promising data to examine and study back home.\n\nBack on Earth, you can invest in upgrading your equipment so you can analyze incoming data more efficiently, boost your telescope signal capacity, or increase your supply of resources\u0026mdash;all to expand the scope of your search that could lead to a discovery of extraterrestrial life forms. Finding traces of extraterrestrial life is only a matter of time \u0026mdash; utilize the resources you have at your disposal strategically and you may well end up being the one to make the biggest scientific contribution towards advancing our understanding of alien life within our galaxy.\n\nYou will also make use of over 200 cards to aid your efforts or focus your research in a particular direction for additional bonuses and rewards. Each card has unique effects and illustrations and depicts real-life technologies, projects, and discoveries (like the ISS, Large Hadron Collider, Perseverance rover, Voyager probe, and many more).\n\nThe game is played in 5 rounds. The player with the starting player marker takes the first turn of the round. Players take turns in clockwise order, skipping any players that have already passed for the round. At the end of round 5, the final score is calculated and the player with the most points wins.\n\nSETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence pays homage to space and planetary exploration, astronomy, the ongoing search for signs of life in the vastness of space, and efforts to understand the nature of life in the universe.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":40,"max_time":160,"avg_rating":841124,"rank":18,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_BUXOVRDU9g_eRwgpR5ZZw__original/img/28ob2JiASW8iX8XoVzp5Y25-h24=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8160466.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_BUXOVRDU9g_eRwgpR5ZZw__small/img/icamIZ4nP3HHH3vczZqTr1hQgKY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8160466.jpg"],"designer":["Tom\u00E1\u0161 Holek:135378"],"artist":["Ond\u0159ej Hrdina:115373","Oto Kandera:160646","Ji\u0159\u00ED K\u016Fs:127825","Jakub Lang:160644","Michaela Loveck\u00E1:160643","Ji\u0159\u00ED Mikovec:145646","Jakub Politzer:94497","Petra Rame\u0161ov\u00E1:160645","Franti\u0161ek Sedl\u00E1\u010Dek:119983","Petr \u0160tich:113177","Petr \u0160tich (III):160642","Josef Sur\u00FD:160641"],"publisher":["Czech Games Edition:7345","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Cranio Creations:10768","Devir:2366","DiceTree Games:23205","DSV Games:54949","Feelindigo:36981","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","HeidelB\u00C4R Games:38505","Hobby Japan:1391","IELLO:8923","MINDOK:7992","MIPL:51614","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"],"category":["Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","End Game Bonuses:2875","Income:2902","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Resource to Move:2948","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:28.8936539Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/286198/seti-rulebook-en","title":"SETI Rulebook [EN]","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/291566/solo-rules-reminders","title":"Solo rules reminders","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/292364/reference-helper","title":"Reference Helper","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/292021/alien-rule-sheets-en","title":"Alien rule sheets [EN]","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/301511/seti-expanse-english-rulebook-fanmade","title":"SETI: Expanse - English Rulebook (Fanmade)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

{"bgg_id":295770,"name":"Frosthaven","year":2022,"description":"Frosthaven is the story of a small outpost far to the north of the capital city of White Oak.  It\u0027s an outpost barely surviving the harsh weather let alone invasions from forces both known and unknown. However, a group of mercenaries, at the end of their rope, will help bring this settlement back from the edge of destruction. Not only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but with other, far more dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold, as well. There are: Algox, the bigger, more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding in from the northern sea; and rumors have it that there are machines that wander the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.\n\nFrosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign.  Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.\n\nIn addition to using the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven features other elements, such as mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how the ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.\n\nFrosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanism for bringing items over from \u0027Gloomhaven\u0027. However, as Frosthaven\u0027s outpost is a remote location, these products may be imported but are not present as standard items. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buying them.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":875526,"rank":20,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cwUgf-f-qwri8UHBUnifuQ__original/img/Tk7wFDJuaU8RPjNkmyC3AWYOPpU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5092291.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cwUgf-f-qwri8UHBUnifuQ__small/img/3o2Hc_N5mmfpOt8s9kP0ap8Jti8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5092291.png"],"designer":["Isaac Childres:69802"],"artist":["Francesca Baerald:79079","David Demaret:66266","Alexandr Elichev:77084","Josh T.

{"bgg_id":28720,"name":"Brass: Lancashire","year":2007,"description":"Brass: Lancashire \u0026mdash; first published as Brass \u0026mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize on demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each phase. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:\n\n\n    Build an industry tile\n    Build a rail or canal\n    Develop an industry\n    Sell cotton\n    Take a loan\n\n\nAt the end of your turn, you replace the two cards you played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, the lowest spender going first. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.\n\nAfter all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed from the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and double-connection builds (though expensive) are possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.\n\nThe cards limit where you can build your industries, sell cotton or build connections (though any card can be used to \u0027develop\u0027). This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if you build a rail line (which requires coal) you have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent\u0027s coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).\n\nBrass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:\n\n\n     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.\n     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.\n     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need of an alternate board.\n     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.\n\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":819697,"rank":22,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tHVtPzu82mBpeQbbZkV6EA__original/img/3ffdJj5Pz6HQrg09Kh8ecTen-TY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3469216.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tHVtPzu82mBpeQbbZkV6EA__small/img/AghH1bAEhqzvyRcP3cy5G-rz0So=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3469216.jpg"],"designer":["Martin Wallace:6"],"artist":["Gavan Brown:32887","Lina Cossette:70571","Peter Dennis:11802","David Forest:70568","Eckhard Freytag:12011","Damien Mammoliti:38179"],"publisher":["Roxley:21765","Warfrog Games:7","Arclight Games:3475","BoardM Factory:25074","Conclave Editora:11043","CrowD Games:34522","Dexker Games:31071","Eagle-Gryphon Games:597","FRED Distribution, Inc.:7097","Funforge:8832","Ghenos Games:4785","Giant Roc:42147","Maldito Games:30677","Pegasus Spiele:39","PHALANX:36186","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Wargames Club Publishing:8759","White Goblin Games:4932"],"category":["Economic:1021","Educational:1094","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Post-Napoleonic:2710","Transportation:1011"],"mechanic":["Chaining:2956","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Income:2902","Loans:2904","Market:2900","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Network and Route Building:2081","Ownership:2911","Tags:3100","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:31.7439038Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/29870/restructured-rules-for-brass","title":"Restructured Rules for Brass","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/30555/variant-rules-for-2-player-game","title":"Variant rules for 2 player game","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/60216/teaching-guide-for-brass-from-the-how-to-play-podc","title":"Teaching Guide for Brass from the How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/34618/brass-en-castellano-version-20-agosto-2008","title":"Brass en castellano.

{"bgg_id":173346,"name":"7 Wonders Duel","year":2015,"description":"In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders. Over three ages, players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders. What\u0027s different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.\n\nPlayers do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it\u0027s not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.\n\nPlayers can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner\u0027s dominance in this area.\n\nYou can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent\u0027s capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent\u0027s capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":807998,"rank":23,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zdagMskTF7wJBPjX74XsRw__original/img/Ju836WNSaW7Mab9Vjq2TJ_FqhWQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2576399.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zdagMskTF7wJBPjX74XsRw__small/img/gV1-ckZSIC-dCxxpq1Y7GmPITzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2576399.jpg"],"designer":["Antoine Bauza:9714","Bruno Cathala:1727"],"artist":["Miguel Coimbra:12016"],"publisher":["Repos Production:4384","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","asmodee:157","Asterion Press:15889","Boardgame Space:34501","CoolPlay:50696","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby Japan:1391","KADABRA:9634","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd:9325","Ludicus Games:30399","Ponva d.o.o.:31904","Pridemage Games:36366","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Siam Board Games:33998","Sombreros Production:32645","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Ancient:1050","Card Game:1002","City Building:1029","Civilization:1015","Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["End Game Bonuses:2875","Income:2902","Melding and Splaying:2981","Modular Board:2011","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846","Open Drafting:2041","Score-and-Reset Game:2823","Set Collection:2004","Sudden Death Ending:2884","Tags:3100","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Track Movement:2939","Tug of War:2888","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:31.7439491Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/127753/official-rules-of-7-wonders-duel","title":"Official rules of 7 Wonders Duel","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/133384/brief-reference-in-size-of-a-wonder-card","title":"Brief reference in size of a Wonder card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/141821/7-wonders-duel-complete-reference-sheet","title":"7 Wonders Duel Complete Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/133346/7-wonders-duel-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"7 Wonders Duel: A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/125145/7-wonders-duel-abbreviated-rules-1-page","title":"7 Wonders Duel - Abbreviated Rules (1 Page)","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/185794/7-wonders-duel-golden-age-variantexpansion-2019811","title":"7 Wonders Duel: Golden Age Variant/Expansion 2019.8.11","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/179461/consolidated-rules-with-pantheon-expansion","title":"Consolidated rules (with Pantheon expansion)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/145646/7-wonder-duel-reference-sheeet-pantheon-plus-promo","title":"7 wonder duel reference sheeet - Pantheon - plus promo cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/144728/7-wonder-duel-base-game-quick-reference","title":"7 Wonder Duel (Base Game) - Quick Reference ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/141633/7-wonders-duel-player-reference-size-of-wonder-car","title":"7 Wonders Duel Player Reference - Size of Wonder Card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/270599/enpl-7wd-enhanced-edition-simple-mod-to-couple-of","title":"[EN/PL] 7WD Enhanced Edition - Simple MOD to couple of the cards and rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":169786,"name":"Scythe","year":2016,"description":"It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as \u0026ldquo;The Factory\u0026rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.\n\nScythe is an engine-building game set in a 1920s era, alternate-history. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player controls one of five factions of Eastern Europe, all of which are attempting to earn their fortunes and claim their stakes in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.\n\nEach player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.\n\nScythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player\u0026rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \u0026ldquo;encounter\u0026rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engines adds to the unique feel of each game, even if having played one faction multiple times.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":115,"max_time":115,"avg_rating":810536,"rank":24,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__original/img/HlDb9F365w0tSP8uD1vf1pfniQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3163924.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__small/img/eQ69OEDdjYjfKg6q5Navee87skU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3163924.jpg"],"designer":["Jamey Stegmaier:62640"],"artist":["Jakub Rozalski:33148"],"publisher":["Stonemaier Games:23202","Albi:4304","Angry Lion Games:38809","Arclight Games:3475","CrowD Games:34522","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Feuerland Spiele:22380","Fire on Board Jogos:30213","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Geekach LLC:58739","Ghenos Games:4785","Korea Boardgames:8291","Ludofy Creative:29242","Maldito Games:30677","Matagot:5400","Morning:28323","PHALANX:36186","Planeta Igor:56068","Playfun Games:34744","Surfin\u0027 Meeple China:36763"],"category":["Economic:1021","Fighting:1046","Science Fiction:1016","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Card Play Conflict Resolution:2857","Contracts:2912","End Game Bonuses:2875","Force Commitment:2864","Grid Movement:2676","Hexagon Grid:2026","King of the Hill:2886","Movement Points:2947","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Take That:2686","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Victory Points as a Resource:2874","Zone of Control:2974"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:31.7440033Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135174/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-scythe-rules-and-refe","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers SCYTHE Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/164974/scythe-frequently-overlookedmisunderstood-rules-re","title":"Scythe: Frequently Overlooked/Misunderstood Rules \u2013 Reference Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/134239/automa-multi-player-rules","title":"Automa Multi-Player Rules","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/161309/scythe-card-and-faction-mat-guide-english","title":"Scythe Card and Faction Mat Guide - English","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/134853/scythe-player-aid-with-rules-and-faction-details","title":"Scythe Player Aid with Rules and Faction Details","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167178/scythe-beginners-orientation-and-reference-tool","title":"Scythe Beginners Orientation \u0026 Reference Tool","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/235578/call-for-reinforcements-12-factions-1-gameplay-var","title":"Call for Reinforcements: 12 Factions, 1 Gameplay Variant","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167180/faction-and-player-mats-reference-sheet","title":"Faction \u0026 Player Mats Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180179/scythe-quick-player-reference","title":"Scythe Quick Player Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/154203/scythe-cheat-sheet-quick-start-guide","title":"Scythe Cheat Sheet - Quick Start Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":167355,"name":"Nemesis","year":2018,"description":"Playing Nemesis will take you into the heart of sci-fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. During the game, you control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. The soldier, on the other hand...\n\nNemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game, you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, agendas held by your fellow players, and sometimes just cruel fate.\n\nThe gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":90,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":825198,"rank":25,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4KSmlm59w0GwLIlgDnJDAQ__original/img/f0VmAKrPrMRQOUcOJHekRvuysDE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8211747.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4KSmlm59w0GwLIlgDnJDAQ__small/img/P20AxSqNHOEM5qT_doqeeE7JAHQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8211747.png"],"designer":["Adam Kwapi\u0144ski:61569"],"artist":["Piotr Foksowicz:39040","Patryk J\u0119draszek:113980","Ewa Labak:114786","Andrzej P\u00F3\u0142toranos:113981"],"publisher":["Awaken Realms:29412","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Arclight Games:3475","asmodee:157","Cranio Creations:10768","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Funforge:8832","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Geekach LLC:58739","Hobby World:18852","Korea Boardgames:8291","MINDOK:7992","Rebel Studio:47684"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Horror:1024","Miniatures:1047","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven:2018","Cooperative Game:2023","Dice Rolling:2072","Hand Management:2040","Hidden Roles:2891","Interrupts:2837","Modular Board:2011","Player Elimination:2685","Semi-Cooperative Game:2820","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Team-Based Game:2019","Traitor Game:2814","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:31.7440721Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/195895/universal-head-esoteric-order-of-gamers-nemesis-ru","title":"Universal Head / Esoteric Order of Gamers NEMESIS Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/223317/utterly-unauthorized-unofficial-rulebook-v1-2","title":"Utterly Unauthorized Unofficial Rulebook v1_2","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/173090/reference-cards-for-frequently-used-rules","title":"Reference cards for frequently used rules.","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/191536/nemesis-rules-flow","title":"Nemesis rules flow","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/227633/mini-expansion-booby-traps-smartgun-and-more","title":"Mini Expansion - Booby traps, Smartgun and more!","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/304160/family-friendly-game-manual-and-house-rules","title":"Family Friendly Game Manual \u0026 House Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/158967/updated-5618-nemesis-prototype-pnp-and-tts-module","title":"Updated 5/6/18 - Nemesis Prototype - PnP and TTS Module - Official Rules FAQ V.04","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/176594/neoprene-playmat-guide","title":"Neoprene Playmat Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/186233/nemesis-unofficial-rules-summary-v3-box-size","title":"Nemesis unofficial rules summary V3 (box size)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/189924/nemesis-basegame-and-all-expansions-rules-summaru","title":"Nemesis_Basegame_and_All_Expansions_Rules_summaru_v4.2","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/224139/character-drafting-reference","title":"Character Drafting Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

{"bgg_id":177736,"name":"A Feast for Odin","year":2016,"description":"A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game. You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today \u0026mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.\n\nWhen the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.\nIn what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason the people of these times became such strong seafarers was their unfortunate agricultural situation: crop shortfalls caused great distress.\n\nIn this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also engage in the day-to-day activity of collecting goods with which to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.\n\n--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer\u0027s review:\nA Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with a plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risks balanced against rewards. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.\n\nEach year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.\n\nAt the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.\n\nYou will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you\u0026rsquo;re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you\u0026rsquo;re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.\n\nUPC 681706716909\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":816309,"rank":27,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__original/img/N1X-0JB1GapFVhl98nP4tNFXMcM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3146943.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__small/img/AKxMMz2DTbBrEynhDROla8fdjJ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3146943.png"],"designer":["Uwe Rosenberg:10"],"artist":["Dennis Lohausen:12484"],"publisher":["Feuerland Spiele:22380","Cranio Creations:10768","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Game Harbor:12540","Hobby World:18852","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lacerta:5812","Maldito Games:30677","Mandala Jogos:35035","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Super Meeple:29409","\u30C6\u30F3\u30C7\u30A4\u30BA\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30BA (TendaysGames):22609","TLAMA games:41423","White Goblin Games:4932","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Animals:1089","Farming:1013","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Medieval:1035","Puzzle:1028"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Automatic Resource Growth:2903","Dice Rolling:2072","Enclosure:2043","Grid Coverage:2978","Hand Management:2040","Income:2902","Layering:3001","Pattern Recognition:2060","Push Your Luck:2661","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Square Grid:2940","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Pass Order:2830","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:31.7441535Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/136602/english-rulebook","title":"English Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/138577/brents-a-feast-for-odin-rules-reminders-and-action","title":"Brent\u0027s A Feast for Odin Rules Reminders and Actions Explanations","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/241110/action-andy-a-feast-for-odin-plus-expansions-compl","title":"ACTION ANDY - A FEAST FOR ODIN \u002B Expansions Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/145902/a-feast-for-odin-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"A Feast for Odin - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/139062/a-two-page-guide-to-all-actions","title":"A two page guide to all Actions","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/255900/setup-guide-affo-w-the-norwegians-plus-me-2-harves","title":"Setup Guide: AFFO w/ The Norwegians \u002B ME #2 \u201CHarvest\u201D (Optional)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/162733/island-quick-reference","title":"Island quick reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/212205/a-feast-for-odin-quick-reference-and-summary-sheet","title":"A Feast for Odin Quick Reference and Summary Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/176628/expansion-board-quick-reference","title":"Expansion board quick reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

{"bgg_id":124361,"name":"Concordia","year":2013,"description":"Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor \u0026mdash; all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!\n\nConcordia is a peaceful, strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:\n\n\n    They allow a player to choose actions during the game.\n    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. \n\n\nConcordia is a strategy game that requires advanced planning and consideration of your opponent\u0027s moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities.

Now you will lead an expedition to explore the island, find lost artifacts, and face fearsome guardians, all in a quest to learn the island\u0027s secrets.\n\nLost Ruins of Arnak combines deck-building and worker placement in a game of exploration, resource management, and discovery. In addition to traditional deck-builder effects, cards can also be used to place workers, and new worker actions become available as players explore the island. Some of these actions require resources instead of workers, so building a solid resource base will be essential. You are limited to only one action per turn, so make your choice carefully... what action will benefit you most now? And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn\u0027t take the action first!?\n\nDecks are small, and randomness in the game is heavily mitigated by the wealth of tactical decisions offered on the game board. With a variety of worker actions, artifacts, and equipment cards, the set-up for each game will be unique, encouraging players to explore new strategies to meet the challenge.\n\nDiscover the Lost Ruins of Arnak!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":807985,"rank":30,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6GqH14TJJhza86BX5HCLEQ__original/img/CXqwimJPonWy1oyXEMgPN_ZVmUI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5674958.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6GqH14TJJhza86BX5HCLEQ__small/img/J8SVmGOJXZGxNjkT3xYNQU7Haxg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5674958.jpg"],"designer":["Elwen:127823","M\u00EDn:127822"],"artist":["Ond\u0159ej Hrdina:115373","Ji\u0159\u00ED K\u016Fs:127825","Filip Murmak:114458","Jakub Politzer:94497","Franti\u0161ek Sedl\u00E1\u010Dek:119983","Milan Vavro\u0148:11961"],"publisher":["Czech Games Edition:7345","Br\u00E4dspel.se:46980","Cranio Creations:10768","Devir:2366","DiceTree Games:23205","Fantasmagoria:22560","GaGa Games:29194","Games4you:52408","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Goblin Gaming:57696","HeidelB\u00C4R Games:38505","Hobby Japan:1391","IELLO:8923","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lex Games:25203","Lord of Boards:46500","MINDOK:7992","More Fun Co., Ltd.:22973","One Moment Games:30552","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Spilbr\u00E6t.dk:44204","White Goblin Games:4932"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Card Game:1002","Exploration:1020","Fantasy:1010"],"mechanic":["Area Movement:2046","Contracts:2912","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Delayed Purchase:2901","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846","Open Drafting:2041","Resource to Move:2948","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Track Movement:2939","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:31.7442778Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/215018/action-andy-lost-ruins-of-arnak-complete-compact-r","title":"ACTION ANDY - LOST RUINS OF ARNAK Complete Compact Rules UPDATED","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/209659/lost-ruins-of-arnak-rulebook","title":"Lost Ruins of Arnak - Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/213706/arnak-solo-mini-expansions-rules-plus-cards-rival","title":"Arnak Solo Mini-expansions RULES \u002B CARDS (Rival Objectives, Purple Actions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/238908/strategy-guide-from-the-forums-combined","title":"Strategy Guide from the forums, combined","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/288599/the-rival-expedition-fanmade-expansion-for-solo-mo","title":"The Rival Expedition - Fanmade expansion for solo mode with 6 rival automas","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/220057/lost-ruins-of-arnak-enlarged-score-sheet-setup-gui","title":"Lost Ruins of Arnak Enlarged Score Sheet / Setup guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/225310/cooperative-mode-cards-and-rules-for-lost-ruins-of","title":"Cooperative Mode (cards and rules) for Lost Ruins of Arnak","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/215010/lost-ruins-of-arnak-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Lost Ruins of Arnak - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/222319/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/276042/lost-ruins-of-arnak-w-expedition-leaders-easy-to-f","title":"Lost Ruins of Arnak (w/ Expedition Leaders): Easy-To Forget Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/255681/lost-ruins-of-arnak-rules-summary","title":"Lost Ruins of Arnak rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the \u0022Great Western Trail\u0022 not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.\n\nIf you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.\n\nThe second edition of Great Western Trail includes solitaire rules, making for a player count of 1-4.\n\nSecond Edition:\nRemember the old days in the West? Well, the times they are a-changing\u0026rsquo;! From new solo opponent to incredible landscapes, you won\u0027t know where to start.

{"bgg_id":205637,"name":"Arkham Horror: The Card Game","year":2016,"description":"Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!\n\nIn the game, you, alone or with a friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets), become investigators within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you\u0027ve dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you\u0027ll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.\n\nNo matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you\u0027ll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world\u0027s most terrifying mysteries.\n\nEach of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You\u0027ll find cultists and foul rituals. You\u0027ll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...\n\nThe basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham\u0027s landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand\u0026mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":2,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":812287,"rank":32,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B5F5ulz0UivNgrI9Ky0euA__original/img/guEKCewM_2e5ugltSN3dTSwdZJI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3122349.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B5F5ulz0UivNgrI9Ky0euA__small/img/L8ouPl5jv2Ye9MC4R_Os2zSGigE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3122349.jpg"],"designer":["Nate French:11655","MJ Newman:40573"],"artist":["Christopher Hosch:50786","Marcin Jakubowski:59237","Ignacio Baz\u00E1n Lazcano:46353","Henning Ludvigsen:24858","Mercedes Opheim:65892","Zoe Robinson:18354","Evan Simonet:59148"],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","Arclight Games:3475","asmodee:157","Asterion Press:15889","Edge Entertainment:2973","Galakta:4617","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby World:18852","Korea Boardgames:8291","Tower Tactic Games:39774","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Card Game:1002","Collectible Components:1044","Exploration:1020","Horror:1024","Novel-based:1093"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Area Movement:2046","Communication Limits:2893","Cooperative Game:2023","Deck Construction:3004","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040","Map Deformation:2961","Modular Board:2011","Player Elimination:2685","Push Your Luck:2661","Role Playing:2028","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Stat Check Resolution:2853","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:31.744373Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150065/checklist-and-visual-guide-of-released-content","title":"Checklist \u0026 Visual Guide of Released Content","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/145933/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-arkham-horror-the-car","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers ARKHAM HORROR: THE CARD GAME Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/266925/arkham-horror-tcg-content-guide","title":"Arkham Horror TCG Content Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/178081/enhanced-campaign-guides","title":"\u0022Enhanced\u0022 campaign guides","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/145950/ahlcg-campaign-guide-card","title":"AHLCG: Campaign Guide Card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180694/ahlcg-encounter-set-guide","title":"AHLCG Encounter Set Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.\n\nThe nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u0026rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.\n\nIn Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability.

Your goal is to work together as a team to land your airplane in different airports around the world.\n\nTo land your plane, you need to silently assign your dice to the correct spaces in your cockpit to balance the axis of your plane, control its speed, deploy the flaps, extend the landing gear, contact the control tower to clear your path, and even have a little coffee to improve your concentration enough to change the value of your dice.\n\nIf the aircraft tilts too much and stalls, overshoots the airport, or collides with another aircraft, you lose the game...and your pilot\u0027s license...and probably your life.\n\nFrom Montreal to Tokyo, each airport offers its own set of challenges.

{"bgg_id":120677,"name":"Terra Mystica","year":2012,"description":"In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each group is bound to its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups.\n\nTerra Mystica is a full information game, without any luck, that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group\u0027s skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.\n\nTaking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group\u0027s special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:\n\n\n    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)\n    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)\n    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)\n    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)\n    Forest (Witches, Auren)\n    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)\n    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)\n\n\nProximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficult...\n\nTerra Mystica FAQ\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":803516,"rank":35,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bre12I1YiXkZr7elvriz4A__original/img/_dZS7fVfdc4DhJPbqnDpwTT4uF0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5375624.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bre12I1YiXkZr7elvriz4A__small/img/GW-ip0dfeAee7KQqJ04SRZxF1lg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375624.jpg"],"designer":["Jens Dr\u00F6gem\u00FCller:4300","Helge Ostertag:4407"],"artist":["Dennis Lohausen:12484"],"publisher":["Feuerland Spiele:22380","Bard Centrum Gier:9074","Capstone Games:30958","Cranio Creations:10768","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","FunBox Jogos:24298","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","HomoLudicus:6275","Mandala Jogos:35035","MINDOK:7992","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","\u30C6\u30F3\u30C7\u30A4\u30BA\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30BA (TendaysGames):22609","White Goblin Games:4932","Z-Man Games:538","Zvezda:1466"],"category":["Civilization:1015","Economic:1021","Fantasy:1010","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Chaining:2956","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hexagon Grid:2026","Income:2902","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Network and Route Building:2081","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Turn Order: Pass Order:2830","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Victory Points as a Resource:2874"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:31.7445582Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/95468/terra-mystica-rules-summary-and-guide","title":"Terra Mystica Rules Summary and Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/104541/terra-mystica-strategy-reference-guide","title":"Terra Mystica Strategy Reference Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/97390/terra-mystica-beginners-guide","title":"Terra Mystica Beginners Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/90938/terra-mystica-player-reference-sheet","title":"Terra Mystica Player Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132125/basic-guide-to-terra-mystica","title":"Basic Guide to Terra Mystica","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/105821/terra-mystica-rules-summary-by-yoki","title":"Terra Mystica Rules Summary by Yoki","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/90979/terra-mystica-english-rules-printer-friendly","title":"Terra Mystica - English Rules - Printer Friendly","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/134220/terra-mystica-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Terra Mystica - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93273/terra-mystica-rules-summary","title":"Terra Mystica Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131391/terra-mystica-teaching-guide-v10","title":"Terra Mystica Teaching Guide v1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/108677/terra-mystica-express-ruleset-v10","title":"Terra Mystica Express Ruleset v1.0","language":"English","file_type":"docx"}]}

{"bgg_id":321608,"name":"Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory","year":2023,"description":"Extended edition includes Crisis \u0026 Control expansion.\n\n\nThe Nation is in disarray and a war is waging between the classes. The working class faces a dismantled welfare system, the capitalists are losing their hard-earned profits, the middle class is gradually fading and the state is sinking into a deep deficit. Amidst all this chaos, the only person who can provide guidance is... you. Will you take the side of the working class and fight for social reforms? Or will you stand with the corporations and the free market? Will you help the government try to keep it all together, or will you try to enforce your agenda no matter the cost to the country?\n\nHegemony is an asymmetric politico-economic card-driven board game for 2-4 players that puts you in the role of one of the socio-economic groups in a fictional state: The Working Class, the Middle Class, the Capitalist Class and the State itself.\n\nThe Working class controls the workers. The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist\u0027s companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.\n\nWhile players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important. Through careful planning, strategic actions and political maneuvering, you will do your best to increase the power of your class and carry out your agenda. Will you be the one to lead your class to victory?\n\nHegemony is heavily based on actual academic principles such as Social-Democracy, Neoliberalism, Nationalism and Globalism, and allows players to see their real world applications through engaging gameplay. There are many ways to achieve hegemony- which one will you take?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":838992,"rank":41,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DCLgJlrvB-EqL6A3WgQLMQ__original/img/vGpYcxjDBCOVcI0BcWOevspTQMQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5715770.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DCLgJlrvB-EqL6A3WgQLMQ__small/img/9yp6ANJx6cqdQqQ6hkNr3zA88vw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5715770.jpg"],"designer":["Vangelis Bagiartakis:35005","Varnavas Timotheou:130887"],"artist":["Dimitris Anastasiadis:149230","Jakub Skop:123835","Katerina Xerovasila:149229"],"publisher":["Hegemonic Project Games:46800","Board Game Rookie:44580","CMON Global Limited:21608","Giant Roc:42147","Lavka Games:34801","MYBG Co., Ltd.:23756","Portal Games:2726"],"category":["Economic:1021","Educational:1094","Negotiation:1026","Political:1001"],"mechanic":["Action / Event:2840","Hand Management:2040","Simulation:2070","Variable Player Powers:2015","Voting:2017","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:34.2713492Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/249967/hegemony-english-rulebook","title":"Hegemony - English Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/258038/unofficial-faq-and-easily-forgotten-rules-compilat","title":"Unofficial FAQ and easily forgotten rules compilation","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/257121/rules-summary-and-player-aid-incl-automa","title":"Rules Summary and Player Aid (incl Automa)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/258336/hegemony-single-thread-rules","title":"Hegemony Single-Thread Rules","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/291090/hegemony-teaching-guide","title":"Hegemony Teaching Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/280405/hegemony-teaching-reference","title":"Hegemony Teaching Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/281779/rules-of-hegemony-v10","title":"Rules of Hegemony V1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/309676/yet-another-hegemony-flow-guide-actions-summary-an","title":"Yet another Hegemony Flow Guide, Actions Summary, and Faction Bag Organizers","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/292565/separate-setup-guides-for-each-player","title":"Separate Setup Guides For Each Player","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/313445/hegemony-phase-and-actions-guide-based-on-jader201","title":"Hegemony Phase \u0026 Actions Guide (based on jader201)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":199792,"name":"Everdell","year":2018,"description":"Within the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding. From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host\u0026mdash;you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?\n\nEverdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.\n\nOn their turn a player can take one of three actions:\n\na) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player\u0027s tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\n\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\n\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":40,"max_time":80,"avg_rating":79874,"rank":42,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fjE7V5LNq31yVEW_yuqI-Q__original/img/HQ1ti16wT9lqja5_h3gUfHUIcVI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3918905.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fjE7V5LNq31yVEW_yuqI-Q__small/img/Cf_mYxR_VvdjTEPXseSurni2JNI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3918905.png"],"designer":["James A.

As members of a deep-sea expedition, you and your fellow crew are on a quest to locate the lost continent of Mu\u0026mdash;but your success depends on precision, teamwork, and a shared sense of timing.\n\nEach mission presents a new puzzle made up of unique tasks: perhaps one player must win a specific card, while another must avoid it entirely. The trick? You\u0026rsquo;ll have to complete these challenges through standard trick-taking rules\u0026mdash;like in traditional card games\u0026mdash;but with extremely limited communication. Each round becomes a tightrope walk of strategic cardplay and silent coordination.\n\nBuilding on the acclaimed system of The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine, this sequel introduces a more dynamic mission system with variable difficulty levels, a fresh deck of task cards, and improved scalability for different player counts. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re playing as a duo or a full five-person team, every game unfolds as a tightly wound tactical dance through the depths.\n\nWith 32 increasingly challenging missions and countless combinations of tasks, The Crew: Mission Deep Sea offers a replayable and rewarding dive into the unknown\u0026mdash;perfect for those who love trick-taking games with a twist of cooperation and pressure.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":20,"max_time":20,"avg_rating":806104,"rank":43,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuBqZ1sMaDAVVHF_OEJP4g__original/img/jGWxczXC_VWZofeAmlO_DkB0hCI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5988903.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuBqZ1sMaDAVVHF_OEJP4g__small/img/EdacXlcFZ06YK0-ZKa0oKwL4VCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5988903.jpg"],"designer":["Thomas Sing:45563"],"artist":["Marco Armbruster:120549"],"publisher":["KOSMOS:37","999 Games:267","Devir:2366","Galakta:4617","Giochi Uniti:5530","GP Games:21640","IELLO:8923","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","MINDOK:7992","MIPL:51614","Piatnik:22","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Thames \u0026 Kosmos:60627","Zvezda:1466"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Card Game:1002","Mythology:1082","Nautical:1008"],"mechanic":["Communication Limits:2893","Cooperative Game:2023","Deduction:3002","Hand Management:2040","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Trick-taking:2009"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:34.2714952Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253496/the-crew-mission-deep-sea-rules-summary","title":"The Crew: Mission Deep Sea rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":183394,"name":"Viticulture Essential Edition","year":2015,"description":"In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meagre vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\n\nThe players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There\u0027s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\n\nFortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them.

{"bgg_id":521,"name":"Crokinole","year":1876,"description":"Crokinole is a traditional two- or four-player dexterity game, played on a circular wooden board, with 3 rings and an inner recessed \u0027bullseye\u0027. A ring of posts is set around the inner circle, which functions as an obstacle to reach this area. Playing pieces are wooden circular disks similar to checkers pieces.  Players take turns shooting disks across the board by flicking them with their fingers in an effort to land them in the highest scoring ring on the board, the highest score (20 points) achieved by shooting a disk into the centre, recessed hole. From the outside in, rings are worth 5, 10, 15 points.\n\nAs a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association\u0027s rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.\n\nEach disk to be shot must be placed on the outer boundary and within the shooting player\u0027s quadrant. If there are no opponent\u0027s disks on the board, the shot disk must land in the inner ring or it is removed. If there is an opponent\u0027s disk on the board, the shot disk must hit an opponent\u0027s piece, either directly, or by bumping another disk into it.  Disks landing in the centre hole are removed and scored at the end of the round. Disks that lie outside--or are touching--the outer boundary after each shot are removed from play for the round.\n\nThe player to score the most points wins the round and scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A \u0022game\u0022 is usually played to four rounds. The number of \u0022games\u0022 in a match is set by the tournament.\n\nAlternatively, play is to a set score, usually the first player or team to 100, and each round is scored by cancellation. For example if Player One scores 250, and Player Two scores 225, then Player One will add 25 to his/her game score.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":806511,"rank":45,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DOwZ7_Q1w68iBhARcDAxig__original/img/0E7UQ_sXErRusbZVixlIiN8MIJQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8549797.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DOwZ7_Q1w68iBhARcDAxig__small/img/nkY1mEj6fItSXJHctfzFcRIcDT0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8549797.jpg"],"designer":["(Uncredited):3"],"artist":["Allison Litchfield:84274","Orlando Ramirez:12965"],"publisher":["(Public Domain):171","(Unknown):3320","alfaset:11748","BrownCastle Games:47309","Carrom Company:755","Cogitate Games:25960","Coleco Industries, Inc.:1139","Crokinole World:7804","Felsberger:5686","Ferti:1562","Gameland \u6E38\u620F\u5927\u9646:38209","Gerhards Spiel und Design:2407","Hilinski Brothers:18842","Industries Prince, Inc.:9942","John Jaques of London:5722","Korea Boardgames:8291","Let\u0027s Play Games!

They are superior vehicles due to them being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and cheaper to run. They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion-engine counterparts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them.\n\nYou will be overseeing the production of these vehicles in Kanban EV, with \u0022kanban\u0022 (\u770B\u677F) being the name for a scheduling system that supports an efficient assembly line, just-in-time production, and a smooth workflow process. Over the course of the game, players take on the role of rookie employees who are trying to secure their career. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve and innovate automobile parts, and get your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production and impress the factory manager.\n\nYou must make shrewd use of the recycling facilities and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate parts when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn\u0027t wait for you or for mistakes. Sandra, the factory manager, will review your performance and keep the factory on tempo.\n\nKanban EV is a game that focuses on resource and time management that puts you in the driver\u0027s seat of an entire production facility, racing for factory goals and the highest level of promotion.

Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player\u0027s \u0022A-cards\u0022; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.\n\nAll of the nearly 220 cards \u0026mdash; whether special or basic \u0026mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use.

{"bgg_id":256960,"name":"Pax Pamir: Second Edition","year":2019,"description":"In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period \u0022The Great Game\u0022 because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.\n\nIn terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game\u0027s map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.\n\nTo survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a \u0022Dominance Check\u0022, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.\n\nAfter each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":45,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":81287,"rank":51,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__original/img/7DlaMCmuoJzm9AzelmStYIDgutI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4503733.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__small/img/NyoufH5YBFCh1rKy4uy76bR4ITk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4503733.png"],"designer":["Cole Wehrle:35585"],"artist":["Cole Wehrle:35585"],"publisher":["Wehrlegig Games:39814","2Tomatoes Games:30571","CrowD Games:34522","Fox in the Box:33710","Galakta:4617","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Giochix.it:7251","Korea Boardgames:8291","Spielworxx:15108","\u30C6\u30F3\u30C7\u30A4\u30BA\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30BA (TendaysGames):22609","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["Economic:1021","Educational:1094","Negotiation:1026","Political:1001","Post-Napoleonic:2710","Spies / Secret Agents:1081"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Area Majority / Influence:2080","Area Movement:2046","Auction: Dutch:2924","Bribery:2913","Hand Management:2040","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Negotiation:2915","Open Drafting:2041","Score-and-Reset Game:2823","Simulation:2070","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tags:3100","Take That:2686"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:34.2717246Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/174408/rulebook-for-pax-pamir-second-edition","title":"Rulebook for Pax Pamir: Second Edition","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/182306/pax-pamir-2nd-edition-guide-4-pages","title":"Pax Pamir 2nd Edition Guide - 4 pages","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/202952/pax-pamir-second-edition-strategy-guide","title":"Pax pamir, second edition - Strategy guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/182406/pax-pamir-teaching-guide","title":"Pax Pamir Teaching Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/184939/player-aid-easily-forgotten-rules","title":"Player Aid - Easily Forgotten Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/264848/pax-pamir-2nd-general-and-wakhan-rules-plus-varian","title":"Pax Pamir 2nd \u2B24 General and Wakhan rules \u002B Variants \u2B24 Complete","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/219779/pax-pamir-second-edition-playing-with-wakhan-rule","title":"Pax Pamir, second edition - Playing with Wakhan \u2013 Rule summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/276264/pax-pamir-2nd-edition-ring-of-rule-stl-file-for-pr","title":"Pax Pamir 2nd edition - Ring of rule STL file for printing","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/280555/pax-pamir-second-edition-rules-summary","title":"Pax Pamir Second Edition rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/186473/pax-pamir-2ed-ruler-tokens","title":"Pax Pamir (2ed) Ruler Tokens","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/243884/zabbys-pax-pamir-2nd-edition-reference-sheet","title":"Zabby\u0027s Pax Pamir 2nd Edition [Reference Sheet]","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}]}

{"bgg_id":3076,"name":"Puerto Rico","year":2002,"description":"In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.\n\nEach player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.\n\nThe resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.\n\nDuring each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \u0022Trader\u0022 or \u0022Builder\u0022). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \u0022Builder\u0022 role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.\n\nPuerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \u0022governor\u0022 token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.\n\nPlayers earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \u0022large buildings.\u0022 Each player\u0027s accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.\n\nIn 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I \u0026ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II \u0026ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.\n\n","min_players":3,"max_players":5,"min_time":90,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":789873,"rank":53,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__original/img/DOgIp57F7tKZvxeITGAd3e_Q9as=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic158548.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__small/img/5fLo89ChZH6Wzukk36bhZ-EpBS0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic158548.jpg"],"designer":["Andreas Seyfarth:117"],"artist":["Franz Vohwinkel:11883"],"publisher":["alea:9","Ravensburger:34","Albi:4304","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Lautapelit.fi:3218","MINDOK:7992","Rio Grande Games:3","Stratelibri:3888","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Tilsit:42","VAKKO:46567"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Farming:1013"],"mechanic":["Action Drafting:2838","End Game Bonuses:2875","Follow:2843","Hidden Victory Points:2987","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Variable Phase Order:2079"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:34.2718035Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/27834/universal-headesoteric-order-of-gamers-puerto-rico","title":"Universal Head/Esoteric Order of Gamers PUERTO RICO Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/49591/all-building-rules","title":"All Building Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/60434/teaching-guide-for-puerto-rico-from-the-how-to-pla","title":"Teaching Guide for Puerto Rico from The How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/62907/two-player-variant-rules","title":"Two-Player Variant Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/53317/puerto-rico-single-sheet-color-coded-quick-guide-v","title":"Puerto Rico Single Sheet Color-Coded Quick Guide (v1.1)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

{"bgg_id":184267,"name":"On Mars","year":2020,"description":"Following the success of unmanned rover missions, the United Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars Exploration (D.O.M.E.). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment of Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony. As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company\u0026rsquo;s private agenda.  In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet\u0027s surface. As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food \u0026mdash; the necessities for survival. Do you dare take part in humankind\u0026rsquo;s biggest challenge?\n\nOn Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase \u200Band the Shuttle Phase\u200B.\n\nDuring the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet\u0026rsquo;s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.\n\nAll buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony\u0026rsquo;s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.\n\nDuring the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":816319,"rank":56,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__original/img/GNjjsgxq7wYO9pSIteDJe6Sxt00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4357658.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__small/img/4GFbhkEWyIublXmikE2Tep6wSIQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4357658.jpg"],"designer":["Vital Lacerda:12396"],"artist":["Ian O\u0027Toole:64844"],"publisher":["Eagle-Gryphon Games:597","Angry Lion Games:38809","Arclight Games:3475","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Giochix.it:7251","hobbity.eu:10562","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lavka Games:34801","Maldito Games:30677","Mosaico Jogos:44349","Skellig Games:40058","TLAMA games:41423","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Exploration:1020","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","Delayed Purchase:2901","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hexagon Grid:2026","Income:2902","Movement Points:2947","Moving Multiple Units:2958","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Tile Placement:2002","Variable Phase Order:2079","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:34.2718779Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193212/on-mars-rules-errata-and-notes","title":"On Mars rules errata and notes","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/190116/on-mars-english-rulebook-final","title":"On Mars - English Rulebook FINAL","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194786/on-mars-solo-rules-summary-and-faq","title":"On Mars Solo Rules Summary \u0026 FAQ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/223482/on-mars-player-reference","title":"On Mars Player Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180739/on-mars-reference-book-v14","title":"On Mars - Reference book V14","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194053/on-mars-2pg-quick-reference-2-4-players","title":"On Mars 2pg Quick Reference 2-4 players","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193347/on-mars-core-concepts","title":"On Mars Core Concepts","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/181065/on-mars-official-english-rulebook-091","title":"On Mars official English Rulebook 0.91","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/258631/quick-start-for-on-mars","title":"Quick Start for On Mars","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/229857/on-mars-rulebook-and-reference-book-reprint-change","title":"On Mars - Rulebook \u0026 Reference Book Reprint - Changelog","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

You and your fellow medical graduates have been recruited by the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to neutralize enemy agents, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.\n\nCombatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it\u0027s not the only threat you\u0027ll encounter in the field. Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it\u0027s critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won\u0027t be without backup. Coordinate with other covert operatives for assistance and make strategic use of these teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.\n\nDesigned as a prequel, Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 does not require you to have completed Season 1 and Season 2 before diving into this Cold War spy thriller. As in the first two Pandemic Legacy games, each time you play brings new cards, rules, and conditions that affect future games. Each alias you create will gain contacts and other assets to execute your plans more smoothly. And, of course, the CIA will be watching and evaluating your performance in the field.

{"bgg_id":295947,"name":"Cascadia","year":2021,"description":"Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that\u0027s paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what\u0027s available \u0026mdash; unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.\n\nIdeally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game\u0027s end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player\u0027s. At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife. Maybe hawks want to be separate from other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears want to be in pairs.

{"bgg_id":102794,"name":"Caverna: The Cave Farmers","year":2013,"description":"Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.\n\nIt\u0027s up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.\n\nYou can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.\n\nCaverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":7,"min_time":30,"max_time":210,"avg_rating":792538,"rank":60,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EAqbd46lFxo-7GumlO8U4w__original/img/oNM6bkDbjww-7nKZX-WYYmPxRws=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5598833.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EAqbd46lFxo-7GumlO8U4w__small/img/g-qxFyjgqn7kwH3erf3jhmgYaIU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5598833.jpg"],"designer":["Uwe Rosenberg:10"],"artist":["Javier Gonz\u00E1lez Cava:85375","Klemens Franz:11507"],"publisher":["Lookout Games:234","999 Games:267","CrowD Games:34522","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Funforge:8832","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Gemenot:24867","Hobby Japan:1391","HomoLudicus:6275","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lacerta:5812","Ludofy Creative:29242","Mayfair Games:10","MINDOK:7992","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","uplay.it edizioni:17786"],"category":["Animals:1089","Economic:1021","Fantasy:1010","Farming:1013"],"mechanic":["Automatic Resource Growth:2903","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:34.2719851Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/95328/caverna-english-rules","title":"Caverna English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/133017/caverna-unofficial-manual-rewrite","title":"Caverna Unofficial Manual Rewrite","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/139590/caverna-missed-rules-and-faq-unofficial","title":"Caverna missed rules and FAQ unofficial","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/140531/caverna-tile-reference-using-game-board-layout","title":"Caverna Tile Reference using Game Board Layout","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/95329/deutsche-regeln-zu-caverna","title":"Deutsche Regeln zu Caverna","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/204908/animal-husbandry-placement-guide","title":"Animal Husbandry Placement Guide","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/142151/eric-s-rules-for-dummy-players-for-caverna-on-a-3","title":"Eric\u2019s Rules for Dummy Players for Caverna on a 3 Player Board","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132525/caverna-player-guide-v10","title":"Caverna Player Guide v1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":185343,"name":"Anachrony","year":2017,"description":"It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.\n\nBy powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...\n\nAnachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them \u0026mdash; and both are in short supply.\n\nThe game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs \u0026mdash; unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past \u0022self\u0022 with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths\u0027 settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":804473,"rank":61,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__original/img/3KfMPSj7jjhG0g5lQBsO-bn67D0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3499707.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__small/img/a0G93aMOKp3_mmnCURYWuZd210U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499707.jpg"],"designer":["D\u00E1vid Turczi:76227","Richard \u00C1mann:76971","Viktor P\u00E9ter:76578"],"artist":["Vill\u0151 Farkas:76972","L\u00E1szl\u00F3 Fejes:85502","Laslo Forgach:91323","M\u00E1rton Gyula Kiss:29978","P\u00E9ter Meszl\u00E9nyi:77167"],"publisher":["Mindclash Games:29156","Albi:4304","Albi Polska:46179","CrowD Games:34522","Engames:39390","Games Warehouse:40478","Ghenos Games:4785","Grok Games:42325","Korea Boardgames:8291","Maldito Games:30677","MYBG Co., Ltd.:23756","Portal Games:2726","Quality Beast:36831","Reflexshop:36563","Skellig Games:40058","Super Meeple:29409","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["Economic:1021","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","Die Icon Resolution:2856","End Game Bonuses:2875","Events:2850","Map Reduction:2960","Open Drafting:2041","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:36.9399768Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/137453/anachrony-final-rulebook","title":"Anachrony Final rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/145614/anachrony-quick-start","title":"Anachrony Quick Start","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/145674/path-related-reference","title":"Path related reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/145092/anachrony-buildings-and-superprojects-reference","title":"Anachrony Buildings \u0026 Superprojects reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/254732/anachrony-complete-setup-guide","title":"Anachrony - COMPLETE Setup Guide!","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/144206/anachrony-rulebook-mobile-friendly-version","title":"Anachrony rulebook - mobile-friendly version","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/154614/anachrony-one-page-rule-summary","title":"Anachrony one page rule summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/137454/anachrony-exosuit-commander-pack-rulebook","title":"Anachrony - Exosuit Commander Pack rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132082/anachrony-wip-ruleboook","title":"Anachrony WIP ruleboook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167896/anachrony-promo-the-sentry-post-rules","title":"Anachrony Promo: The Sentry Post - Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/196135/original-chronobot-solo-mode-rules","title":"Original Chronobot Solo Mode Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/208785/anachrony-infinity-rulebook","title":"Anachrony - Infinity rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/195656/anachrony-essential-edition-rulebook","title":"Anachrony Essential Edition Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167878/anachrony-scoring-sheet-improved","title":"Anachrony scoring sheet improved","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/217875/anachrony-chronobot-and-chronossus-solo-opponents","title":"Anachrony - Chronobot and Chronossus Solo Opponents Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/213678/anachrony-superprojects-reference-include-all-expa","title":"Anachrony Superprojects reference (include all expansions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":414317,"name":"Harmonies","year":2024,"description":"In Harmonies, build landscapes by placing colored tokens and create habitats for your animals. To earn the most points and win the game, incorporate the habitats in your landscapes wisely and have as many animals as you can settle there.\n\nStarting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player will choose a set of 3 terrain tokens from the central area to place on their personal board. They may optionally choose an Animal card from the 5 displayed and/or place an Animal cube from their Animal card(s) on any completed patterns on their board that match their personal Animal cards. There is a 4-card limit per player. After their turn, refill with a new set of 3 tokens and a new Animal card if needed.\n\nPlacement of the terrain tokens will depend on the personal Animal card goals, and scoring rules for the various terrain types (mountain, field, forest, etc). For example, mountain tiles score based on how high they are (1 tile scores 1, while 3 tiles stacked score 7), but the mountain scores zero if it is not adjacent to at least one other mountain. If all the cubes on a given Animal card have been placed, the card is set aside and a new card can be drawn. The cards are scored at game end based on the highest number that isn\u0027t covered by a cube.\n\nThe games ends when there are no tokens left in the bag to refill the central area, or at least one players has 2 or fewer empty spaces on their player board. Play continues until all players have had an equal turn that round. The player with the highest points is the winner.\n\nOptionally, you can use Nature\u0027s Spirit cards for richer gameplay. During setup, each player chooses 1 of 2 spirit cards and places a Spirit cube on the card. They follow the same placement rules as Animal cards, but tend to have an ongoing effect once completed. The spirit card does count towards the 4-card hand limit.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":802967,"rank":62,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A_XP2_VN3ugyqPhezowB_w__original/img/_Rv8lSr3fC1oDRkrQleQW2H2yCs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8026369.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A_XP2_VN3ugyqPhezowB_w__small/img/ln5eKAzhse2PIHvWn7bu-jiW_uk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8026369.png"],"designer":["Johan Benvenuto:95323"],"artist":["Ma\u00EBva da Silva:40295"],"publisher":["Libellud:9051","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","CoolPlay:50696","CrowD Games:34522","Fj\u00F3rir \u00C1sar:55730","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby Japan:1391","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Abstract Strategy:1009","Animals:1089","Environmental:1084"],"mechanic":["Chaining:2956","Hexagon Grid:2026","Open Drafting:2041","Pattern Building:2048","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tile Placement:2002","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:36.9400274Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/276502/official-harmonies-rulebook","title":"Official Harmonies rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/279849/unofficial-solo-automa","title":"Unofficial Solo Automa","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/278704/quick-setup-and-refresher","title":"Quick Setup \u0026 Refresher","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/283640/mini-rule-change-for-duel","title":"Mini rule change for duel","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}
{"bgg_id":170216,"name":"Blood Rage","year":2015,"description":"\u0022Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL\u0022\n\nIn Blood Rage, players control the warriors, leader, and ship of their own Viking clan. Ragnar\u0026ouml;k has come and it\u0026rsquo;s the end of the world! It\u0026rsquo;s the Vikings\u0026rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their places in Valhalla at Odin\u0026rsquo;s side! As a Viking you can pursue one of many pathways to glory. You can: invade and pillage the land for its rewards; crush your opponents in battle: fulfill quests: increase your clan\u0027s stats: or even die gloriously in battle or from Ragnar\u0026ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.\n\nMost player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \u0026ldquo;Gods\u0026rsquo; Gifts\u0026rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having many of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle. Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises. Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles or punishes the winner.\n\nPlayers must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents\u0026rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent\u0026rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":790294,"rank":63,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__original/img/Myy6IPDJDzLoPdXrPXVZcddBQoQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2439223.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__small/img/NLhVdU8xazrgS5dA6nVCYmN2DNI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2439223.jpg"],"designer":["Eric M.

{"bgg_id":31260,"name":"Agricola","year":2007,"description":"In Agricola, you\u0027re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. At first, on a turn, your family gets to take only two actions, one for you and one for your spouse, as might be found among all the possibilities on a farm: plowing fields; collecting materials; building fences, and so on. There are numerous choices available, and while the game progresses you\u0027ll have more and more, as each round a new action card is flipped over, offering one more possible action. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished but first you\u0027ll need to expand your house to make room - and what are you going to feed all the little rug rats?\n\nThe game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the distribution of cards which represent Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner\u0027s version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release) these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist. Each player starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit into his/her strategy.\n\nAgricola is a turn-based game, and the problem to be overcome is that each available action can be taken by only one player each round so it\u0027s important to be careful about your choices.  There are countless strategies, some of which depend on your hand of cards.\n\nThe winner is the player with the most Victory Points from the Improvements made on his farm.\n\n-description originally from BoardgameNews\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":30,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":785982,"rank":64,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__original/img/toobKoejPiHpfpHk4SYd1UAJafw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic831744.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__small/img/GHGdnCfeysoP_34gLnofJcNivW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic831744.jpg"],"designer":["Uwe Rosenberg:10"],"artist":["Klemens Franz:11507"],"publisher":["Lookout Games:234","999 Games:267","Brain Games:7162","Compaya.hu: Gamer Caf\u00E9 Kft.:14813","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Funforge:8832","Hobby Japan:1391","Hobby World:18852","HomoLudicus:6275","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lacerta:5812","MINDOK:7992","Smart Ltd:8313","Stratelibri:3888","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Ystari Games:2861","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Animals:1089","Economic:1021","Farming:1013"],"mechanic":["Automatic Resource Growth:2903","Closed Drafting:2984","Enclosure:2043","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:36.9400907Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/37542/carthaginians-score-o-matic-wheel","title":"Carthaginian\u0027s score-o-matic wheel","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66033/universal-head-agricola-rules-summary","title":"Universal Head AGRICOLA Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/41924/jumbo-playing-guide-for-agricola","title":"Jumbo playing guide for Agricola","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/34719/agricola-card-list-and-cardrule-errata","title":"Agricola Card List and Card/Rule Errata","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/26990/english-rules-for-agricola-translated-from-german","title":"English rules for Agricola (translated from German)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/62194/teaching-guide-for-agricola-from-the-how-to-play-p","title":"Teaching Guide for Agricola from The How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/27166/agricola-english-rules-v0-original-format","title":"Agricola English rules v.0 (original format)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/42428/rules-summary-for-new-players","title":"Rules Summary for New Players","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/154116/agricola-strategy-and-tactics-guide","title":"Agricola Strategy and Tactics Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

{"bgg_id":231733,"name":"Obsession","year":2018,"description":"You are the head of a respected but troubled family estate in mid-19th century Victorian England. After several lean decades, family fortunes are looking up! Your goal is to improve your estate so as to be in better standing with the truly influential families in Derbyshire.\n\nObsession is a game of 16 to 20 turns in which players build a deck of Victorian gentry (British social upper class), renovate their estate by acquiring building tiles from a centralized builders\u0027 market, and manipulate an extensive service staff of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and footmen utilizing a novel worker placement mechanic. Successfully hosting prestigious social activities such as Fox Hunts, Music Recitals, Billiards, Political Debates, and Grand Balls increases a player\u0027s wealth, reputation, and connections among the elite.\n\nEach turn, players choose a building tile representing a room or outdoor space in and around their 19th century British country house. The tile chosen dictates the event that can be hosted and the guests to be invited. Players must carefully plan, however, to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed. The reward for success is new investment opportunities, permitting further renovation of the estate (acquisition of more valuable/powerful building tiles), an increase in reputation in the county, an expanding circle of influential acquaintances, and a larger and highly-trained domestic staff.\n\nThroughout the game, a competitive courtship for the hand of the most eligible young gentleman and lady in the county presents specific renovation and reputation objectives. The player who best meets these objectives while accumulating victory points will win the hand of the wealthy love interest and the game.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":807996,"rank":66,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__original/img/uArsqbWyUALa982zGWsy8QQWnjE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5902073.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__small/img/eTnMwfCC2jCGDPXC08SIaMXNOTM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5902073.png"],"designer":["Dan Hallagan:102328"],"artist":["Dan Hallagan:102328"],"publisher":["Kayenta Games:36949","4GAMES:54051","Boardgame Mall:48941","CMON Global Limited:21608","Giochix.it:7251","Lucrum Games:27470","Maldito Games:30677","Strohmann Games:45845","Super Meeple:29409","TTGames CZ:56411"],"category":["Post-Napoleonic:2710"],"mechanic":["Action Retrieval:2839","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Hand Management:2040","Open Drafting:2041","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:36.9401598Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/206031/obsession-2nd-edition-rulebook","title":"Obsession 2nd Edition Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/270290/obsession-game-guide","title":"Obsession Game Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/291744/illustrated-improvement-tile-reference-for-obsessi","title":"Illustrated Improvement Tile Reference for Obsession","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/208762/obsession-2nd-printing-summary","title":"Obsession 2nd printing summary","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/270073/obsession-setup-guide-and-references","title":"Obsession Setup Guide and References","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/233127/obsession-2e-rules-formatted-for-simple-teaching-a","title":"Obsession 2E rules formatted for simple teaching and reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/281392/obsession-rulebook-23e","title":"Obsession Rulebook (2.3E)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/174832/obsession-game-aid-3-pages-1st-edition","title":"Obsession game aid - 3 pages (1st edition)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/307757/action-andy-obsession-with-all-expansions-complete","title":"ACTION ANDY - OBSESSION with all expansions Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/216757/rule-clarifications-and-errata-for-obsession-2e-an","title":"Rule Clarifications \u0026 Errata for Obsession 2E and Upstairs, Downstairs","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/226303/obsession-w-ud-set-up-guides-new-version-12324","title":"Obsession w/ UD - Set-up Guides - NEW VERSION (1/23/24)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/232150/official-obsession-3rd-printing-rulebook","title":"Official Obsession 3rd Printing Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/254069/obsession-complete-condensed-rules-for-edition-22e","title":"Obsession complete condensed rules for edition 2.2E","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/169016/improvement-tile-reference-brochure-style","title":"Improvement Tile Reference (Brochure Style)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/205062/obsession-rules-summary","title":"Obsession Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/169017/improvement-tile-reference-single-sheet","title":"Improvement Tile Reference (Single Sheet)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/209443/obsession-2nd-printing-summary-with-expansions","title":"Obsession 2nd printing summary (with expansions)","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}]}
{"bgg_id":182874,"name":"Grand Austria Hotel","year":2015,"description":"In the thick of the Viennese modern age, exquisite caf\u0026eacute;s are competing for customers. Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf\u0026eacute; into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor\u0027s favor. Only then will your caf\u0026eacute; become the Grand Austria Hotel.\n\nThe start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.\n\nBut no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.\n\nWith 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value.

{"bgg_id":161533,"name":"Lisboa","year":2017,"description":"Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of Lisboa after the great earthquake of 1755.\n\nOn November 1, 1755, Lisbon suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5\u0026ndash;9.0, followed by a tsunami and three days of fires. The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal \u0026mdash; Sebasti\u0026atilde;o Jos\u0026eacute; de Carvalho e Melo \u0026mdash; was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.\n\nLisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon. During the planning of the downtown project, the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined. The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game, making each game a totally different experience. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and whoever gathers the most wigs by the end of the game wins.\n\nLisboa is played in rounds. Each round, all players play one turn. They may place one card on their display or replace one card from this display. During the game, players schedule hearings to get character favors, such as commerce, construction, and openings. The iconic buildings score the stores and stores provide income to the players. Players need to manage influence, construction licenses, store permits, church power, workers and money, with the workers\u0027 cost being dependent on the prestige of the players.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":816962,"rank":68,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OrHS8_a1CqSGiXeTfCk0Wg__original/img/hVArRkZYHiPTGTfi0DPR58i4o44=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3209553.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OrHS8_a1CqSGiXeTfCk0Wg__small/img/ZBTT0qZcD5HMFlhFN7PLMe6zXvg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3209553.jpg"],"designer":["Vital Lacerda:12396"],"artist":["Ian O\u0027Toole:64844"],"publisher":["Eagle-Gryphon Games:597","Angry Lion Games:38809","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Giochix.it:7251","hobbity.eu:10562","Lavka Games:34801","Maldito Games:30677","Mandala Jogos:35035","TLAMA games:41423","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Political:1001"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Hand Management:2040","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Open Drafting:2041","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tile Placement:2002"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:36.940203Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/139113/official-english-rulebook-final","title":"Official English Rulebook Final","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/218181/action-andy-lisboa-plus-promo-complete-compact-rul","title":"ACTION ANDY - Lisboa \u002B Promo Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/151166/another-rules-summary-teaching-outline","title":"Another Rules Summary / Teaching Outline","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150643/single-page-solitaire-rules","title":"Single Page Solitaire Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/153774/consolidated-2-player-rules-1-pager","title":"Consolidated 2-Player Rules (1 pager)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/207785/lisboa-basic-turn-reference","title":"Lisboa Basic Turn Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/155914/lisboa-game-aid-5-pages","title":"Lisboa game aid - 5 pages","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/249836/lisboa-gameplay-and-references-actions-tofrom-reso","title":"Lisboa gameplay and references actions to/from resources","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/182479/1-page-turn-sequence-summary-guide","title":"1 Page Turn Sequence Summary Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/204820/lisboa-detailed-1-page-rules-summary","title":"Lisboa Detailed 1-page Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/223473/super-quick-setup","title":"Super Quick Setup","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}]}

{"bgg_id":126163,"name":"Tzolk\u0027in: The Mayan Calendar","year":2012,"description":"Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement. Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.\n\nDuring a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker.

{"bgg_id":2651,"name":"Power Grid","year":2004,"description":"Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.\n\nThe objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone\u0027s network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.\n\nHowever, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you\u0027re potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nAdditionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the \u0027renewable\u0027 windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\n\u261B Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

{"bgg_id":240980,"name":"Blood on the Clocktower","year":2022,"description":"In the quiet village of Ravenswood Bluff, \u0026zwnj;a demon walks amongst you. During a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight, there echoes a bone-chilling scream. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the town storyteller murdered, their body impaled on the hands of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in time to execute the true demon and save themselves? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful village?\n\nBlood on the Clocktower is a bluffing game with players on opposing teams of Good and Evil, overseen by a Storyteller player who conducts the action and makes crucial decisions. The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.\n\nDuring a \u0027day\u0027 phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player\u0027s execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. During a \u0027night\u0027 time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.\n\nThe Storyteller uses the game\u0027s intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave. If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it\u0027s started as a powerful Traveller character with unusual talents and questionable allegiances. Each character comes with their own special ability and no two players in a game are ever the same character.\n\n","min_players":6,"max_players":21,"min_time":30,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":83588,"rank":74,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__original/img/e7izEwSmnBPiErsIF6hlWbgybBE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7009391.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__small/img/cRCX-PIROiSFG5aLvwkn2O7tHsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7009391.jpg"],"designer":["Steven Medway:105325"],"artist":["Micaela Dawn:120101","Aidan Roberts:151198","John VanFleet:14773","Grace VanFleet:151197"],"publisher":["The Pandemonium Institute:39568","A-Z kiad\u00F3:56756","Bumble3ee Interactive:48072","Fox in the Box:33710","Funtails:40576","Old Dawg:55187","Open Sesame Games:44780"],"category":["Bluffing:1023","Deduction:1039","Murder / Mystery:1040","Party Game:1030"],"mechanic":["Betting and Bluffing:2014","Deduction:3002","Hidden Roles:2891","Negotiation:2915","Player Elimination:2685","Prisoner\u0027s Dilemma:2858","Rock-Paper-Scissors:2003","Roles with Asymmetric Information:2892","Team-Based Game:2019","Traitor Game:2814","Variable Player Powers:2015","Voting:2017"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:36.9403893Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253824/blood-on-the-clocktower-rulebook-v1","title":"Blood on the Clocktower - Rulebook - V1","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/230580/trouble-brewing-edition-character-reference-night","title":"Trouble Brewing edition: Character reference, Night sheet, Character tokens, Grimoire tokens, Information cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/257596/botc-reference-for-a-tv-screen","title":"BotC Reference for a TV Screen","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/192702/flow-of-game-reference-for-storytellers","title":"Flow of Game Reference (for Storytellers)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/238590/sects-and-violets-edition-character-reference-nigh","title":"Sects and Violets edition: Character reference, Night sheet, Character tokens, Grimoire tokens","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/238646/bad-moon-rising-edition-character-reference-night","title":"Bad Moon Rising edition: Character reference, Night sheet, Character tokens, Grimoire tokens","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/222205/resource-for-teaching-new-storytellers-in-your-onl","title":"Resource for teaching new Storytellers in your online group ","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/238823/travellers-and-fabled-character-reference-characte","title":"Travellers and Fabled: Character reference, Character tokens, Grimoire tokens","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":216132,"name":"Clans of Caledonia","year":2017,"description":"Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.\n\nPlayers represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!\n\nThe game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:\n\n\n     Players\u0027 turns\n     Production phase\n     Round scoring\n\n\n1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions, from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting. When players run out of money, they pass and collect a passing bonus.\n\n2. In the production phase, each player collects basic resources, refined goods and cash from their production units built on the game map. Each production unit built makes income visible on the player mat. Refined goods require the respective basic resource.\n\n3.

{"bgg_id":371942,"name":"The White Castle","year":2023,"description":"The heron flies over the Himeji sky while the Daimyo, from the top of the castle, watches his servants move. Gardeners tend the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls, and courtiers crowd the gates, pining for an audience that brings them closer to the innermost circles of the court. When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.\n\nIn The White Castle, players will control one of these clans in order to score more victory points than the rest. To do so, they must amass influence in the court, manage resources boldly, and place their workers in the right place at the right time. The authors are Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero, the duo known as Llama Dice who also designed the successful The Red Cathedral with Devir. In this case, we leave the Moscow of Ivan the Terrible behind to explore the most imposing fortress in modern Japan, Himeji Castle, where the banner of the Sakai clan flies under the orders of Daimyo Sakai Tadakiyo.\n\nThe White Castle is a Euro type game with mechanics of resource management, worker placement and dice placement to carry out actions. During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.\n\nThe central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimyo to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.\n\nWith accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups. As is tradition with Llama Dice titles, its sleek and simple design belies a great deal of strategic depth within the grasp of players.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":80,"max_time":80,"avg_rating":798258,"rank":76,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qXT1U-nFh9PE8ujfdmI7dA__original/img/jzmifZJ0Sg2Js7hmQjzX7bEHVBY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7754663.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qXT1U-nFh9PE8ujfdmI7dA__small/img/ru1l95gdKNXSsByDglE9Xxgu0kE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7754663.jpg"],"designer":["Isra C.:77002","Shei S.:77173"],"artist":["Joan Guardiet:32071"],"publisher":["Devir:2366","999 Games:267","Banana Games:35928","CMON Global Limited:21608","GaGa Games:29194","Games4you:52408","Games7Days:48438","IELLO:8923","KOSMOS:37","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Portal Games:2726","Reflexshop:36563","TLAMA games:41423"],"category":["Dice:1017","Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["Action Drafting:2838","Area Movement:2046","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Income:2902","Melding and Splaying:2981","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Open Drafting:2041","Race:2876","Resource Queue:3103","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement with Dice Workers:2935"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:36.9404426Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/265611/the-white-castle-official-rulebook","title":"The White Castle official rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/287800/gingkogawa-clan-solo-rules-re-write","title":"Gingkogawa Clan solo - rules re-write","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/289122/quick-start-for-the-white-castle","title":"Quick Start for The White Castle","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/308379/the-white-castle-gingkogawa-clan-a-solo-rules-re-r","title":"The White Castle - Gingkogawa Clan - A solo rules (re-re-)rewrite","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/302991/simple-score-pad-w-instructions-3x-per-8x10","title":"Simple Score Pad w/ Instructions (3x per 8x10)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.\n\nThe aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game\u0027s end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":79589,"rank":78,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__original/img/9ktZDu003VVVTw0RxD-ufLYV1HQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4462987.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__small/img/1gEbke_bKTA6D2jjpPm1HowGGHM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4462987.png"],"designer":["S J Macdonald:103821","Shem Phillips:12547"],"artist":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski:70533"],"publisher":["Garphill Games:9459","Renegade Game Studios:28072","Banana Games:35928","CMON Global Limited:21608","Fever Games:27480","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lavka Games:34801","Lord of Boards:46500","Meeple:49615","MeepleBR:32591","Pixie Games:30034","Portal Games:2726","Primigenio:30490","Reflexshop:36563","Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844","TLAMA games:41423","White Goblin Games:4932","\u682A\u5F0F\u4F1A\u793E\u30B1\u30F3\u30D3\u30EB (KenBill):37975"],"category":["Medieval:1035"],"mechanic":["End Game Bonuses:2875","Market:2900","Open Drafting:2041","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:36.9405128Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/189465/quick-player-guide","title":"Quick Player Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/177338/official-paladins-rulebook","title":"Official Paladins Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194112/action-andy-paladins-of-the-west-kingdom-complete","title":"ACTION ANDY - Paladins Of The West Kingdom Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/189808/paladins-of-the-west-kingdom-player-aid","title":"Paladins of the West Kingdom Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/188364/paladins-of-the-west-kingdom-a-plain-and-simple-gu","title":"Paladins of the West Kingdom - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/229262/guides-for-playing-paladins-of-the-west-kingdom-so","title":"Guides for Playing Paladins of the West Kingdom SOLO (with and w/out City of Crowns)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/190305/paladins-of-the-west-kingdom-quick-rules-guide","title":"Paladins of the West Kingdom Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/191224/paladins-of-the-west-kingdoms-reference-sheet-page","title":"Paladins of the West Kingdoms - Reference Sheet (Page 1)","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/254696/guide-for-playing-paladins-of-the-west-kingdom-coo","title":"Guide for Playing Paladins of the West Kingdom COOP!","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships.

Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.\n\nAfter every seven turns, the round ends: players\u0027 cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers.

{"bgg_id":124742,"name":"Android: Netrunner","year":2012,"description":"Welcome to New Angeles, home of the Beanstalk. From our branch offices in this monument of human achievement, NBN proudly broadcasts all your favorite media programming. We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee, news and sitcoms, classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that\u0027s fit to view.\n\nAndroid: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.\n\nCorporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with \u0022ice\u0022. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation\u0027s virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.\n\nIn turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It\u0027s not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort\u0027s defenses, there\u0027s no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value.

{"bgg_id":164153,"name":"Star Wars: Imperial Assault","year":2014,"description":"Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!\n\nImperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire\u0026rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.\n\nIn the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire\u0026rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.\n\nImperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You\u0026rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you\u0026rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.\n\nAs an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.\n\nWith these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you\u0027ll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":795447,"rank":83,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pIQ_MXvaoARRp1loCHJuHg__original/img/12Xvbw01hpsAjsO0xrajZt2b5HY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2247647.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pIQ_MXvaoARRp1loCHJuHg__small/img/AD5YvNSUaVvITmtQb1-b01VuBbs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2247647.jpg"],"designer":["Justin Kemppainen:72460","Corey Konieczka:6651","Jonathan Ying:78796"],"artist":["Arden Beckwith:78030","Christopher Burdett:19411","Rovina Cai:72509","Lucas Durham:73895","Joel Hustak:69246","Michal Ivan:36621","David Kegg:48500","Henning Ludvigsen:24858","Brynn Metheney:47549","Vlad Ricean:104761","Ryan Valle:68942","Ben Zweifel:49280"],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","Asterion Press:15889","Edge Entertainment:2973","Galakta:4617","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby World:18852"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Exploration:1020","Fighting:1046","Miniatures:1047","Movies / TV / Radio theme:1064","Science Fiction:1016","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Dice Rolling:2072","Die Icon Resolution:2856","Grid Movement:2676","Line of Sight:2975","Modular Board:2011","Role Playing:2028","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Square Grid:2940","Team-Based Game:2019","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:39.7227457Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/114435/universal-headesoteric-order-of-gamers-star-wars-i","title":"Universal Head/Esoteric Order of Gamers STAR WARS: IMPERIAL ASSAULT Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/168240/the-consolidated-star-wars-imperial-assaulttm-rule","title":"The Consolidated Star Wars: Imperial Assault\u2122 Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/210690/heroes-and-villains-expansion-54-new-hero-sheets-5","title":"Heroes and Villains Expansion - 54 New Hero Sheets, 551 New Class Cards (Fan-Made)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/117642/campaign-tile-guide","title":"Campaign Tile Guide","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180007/redjaks-automated-imperial-raiv-expanded","title":"RedJak\u0027s Automated Imperial (RAIV) - Expanded","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/112888/quick-reference-sheets","title":"Quick Reference Sheets","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/218088/imperial-commander-unofficial-companion-app-for-so","title":"Imperial Commander: Unofficial companion app for solo / coop play - Quick Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/128736/imperial-assault-reference-cards","title":"Imperial Assault - Reference Cards","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":55690,"name":"Kingdom Death: Monster","year":2015,"description":"Kingdom Death: Monster is a fully cooperative tabletop hobby game experience.  Set in a unique nightmarish world devoid of most natural resources, you control a settlement at the dawn of its existence. Fight monsters, craft weapons and gear, and develop your settlement to ensure your survival from generation to generation.\n\nCampaign System\nEmbark alone or with up to 3 friends (5 with game variant) on a 5-30-lantern-year campaign, with each year consisting of a cycle of hunt, showdown, and settlement phases. The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival.  During the hunt, you\u0027ll encounter a series of stories in a \u0022choose your own adventure\u0022 style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you\u0027re pursuing, you\u0027ll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.  If your party lives, you\u0027ll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.\n\nMonster AI System\nEach of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it\u0027s HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.\n\nGear System\nIn Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.\n\nStory Event System\n40\u002B Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign.

Recruit surface survivors to your cause. Build factories with powerful machines. And populate ancient sites to relearn your tribe\u0027s forgotten technologies.\n--\nRevive is a game for 1-4 players with asymmetric player powers, highly variable setup, and no fighting or direct conflict. Playing through the 5-part campaign unlocks additional contents, and once all contents have been unlocked, the game can be replayed indefinitely.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player gets a set of citizen cards, a tribe board, as well as a huge dual-layer player board. The tribe board shows your unique tribe ability and the ancient technologies that you may relearn during the game. The dual-layer player board is where you place your custom machines and upgrade your card slots.\n\nA main goal of the game is to reach and populate the large ancient sites. These ancient locations are randomized, and as they are important sources of victory points, they will shape your strategy differently each game. The game ends when all artifacts have been taken, and the player with the most points wins.\n\nOn your turn you take two actions: \n\n     Play a card (its effect is determined by which card slot you use)\n     Explore (reveal an area tile and recruit a new citizen card)\n     Populate (populate an ancient location to learn a new technology)\n     Build factory (the adjacent terrains determine which machine tracks you advance)\n\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":806959,"rank":90,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0OZ9QR0pC9G5t5i9MoZTQ__original/img/NxxAoxVxMNkDGEkD3aoobPL14dI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6950224.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0OZ9QR0pC9G5t5i9MoZTQ__small/img/NPtXuKlsnfPORSn6kpTcf-ZdEF0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6950224.jpg"],"designer":["Helge Meissner:109214","Kristian Amundsen \u00D8stby:4063","Eilif Svensson:9637","Anna Wermlund:109215"],"artist":["Gjermund Bohne:76491","Martin Mottet:119304","Dan Roff:134667","Jessy T\u00F6pfer:141504"],"publisher":["Aporta Games:27674","Across the Board:39686","BGA Plus:51066","Board Game Rookie:44580","Boardgame Mall:48941","Devir:2366","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Ghenos Games:4785","Hobby Japan:1391","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd:9325","Matagot:5400","MINDOK:7992","Pegasus Spiele:39","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Surfin\u0027 Meeple China:36763"],"category":["Civilization:1015","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Hexagon Grid:2026","Map Addition:2959","Network and Route Building:2081","Open Drafting:2041","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:39.7230499Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/243889/english-rules","title":"English rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/259821/mautoma-solo-mode","title":"Mautoma solo mode","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/256745/player-aidbasic-rules-summary","title":"Player Aid/Basic Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/257089/iconography-reference-and-end-game-scoring","title":"Iconography reference and end game scoring","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/250303/rule-cards-summary-spoiler","title":"Rule cards summary (SPOILER)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/305758/revive-rules-in-a-wink","title":"REVIVE Rules IN A WINK","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/269840/revive-reference-remix","title":"Revive Reference Remix","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/286924/revive-rules-summary-and-icon-guide","title":"Revive Rules Summary \u0026 Icon Guide","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/269730/quick-start-for-revive","title":"Quick Start for Revive","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/287828/revive-card-sized-rules-aid-with-expansion","title":"Revive Card Sized Rules Aid (with expansion)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/290191/rulebook-including-optional-rules","title":"Rulebook including optional rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":337627,"name":"Voidfall","year":2023,"description":"For centuries, the Novarchs, descendants of the royal House of Novarchon, have ruled with an iron fist over the feudalistic galactic empire of humankind, the Domineum. During this time, they brought stunning technological innovation and scientific advancements to their domain. This accelerated progression helped the Domineum reach \u0026mdash; and eventually inhabit \u0026mdash; even the farthest segments of the known galaxy, where new Houses emerged to govern the outer sectors of the empire. As the House of Novarchon grew in power, so grew the religious cult that surrounded them, proclaiming grim prophecies about an ancient cosmic being from another dimension: the Voidborn.\n\nMany thought it to be only a myth, but in truth, it was the Voidborn\u0027s dark influence that granted the Novarchs the sheer knowledge to achieve rapid expansion for the empire. While the cult of the Novarchs envisaged eternal life through the otherworldly entity, the Voidborn\u0027s only intention was satiating its eternal hunger. And so, when the Domineum had achieved a vastness fitting the Voidborn\u0027s craving, interdimensional rifts opened at the heart of the Domineum to unleash cosmic corruption. As the House of Novarchon and its followers welcomed the Voidborn and sought their false salvation, the entity infected and spread and seized control over the inner worlds. Now, it is time for the remaining Great Houses to purge the galactic corruption, prevent the Voidborn from fully manifesting in our dimension, and to ultimately overcome the chaos as the new rulers of the Domineum.\n\nVoidfall is a space 4X game that brings the genre to Euro enthusiasts\u0027 tables. It combines the tension, player interaction, and deep empire customization of the 4X genre with the resource management, tight decisions, and minimum-luck gameplay of an economic Euro. Win by pushing back the Voidborn in the solo/coop mode, or by overcoming your rivals\u0027 influence in restoring the Domineum in the competitive mode \u0026mdash; both using the same rule set and game system. Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.\n\nAs the leader of a defiant Great House, you play through three cycles, each with a game-altering galactic event, a new scoring condition, and a set number of focus cards that can be played. Focus card decisions and sequencing is the centerpiece of the gameplay. By selecting two of their three impactful actions as you play them, you develop and improve techs; advance on your three house-specific civilization tracks; manage your sectors\u0027 infrastructure, population, and production; and conquer new sectors with up to five different types of space fleets. Space battles are fought either against the Voidborn\u0027s infected forces (which are present as neutral opponents even in the competitive mode) or against other players. Instead of relying on the luck of a die roll, battles in Voidfall are fully deterministic and reward careful preparation and outsmarting your opponents.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":851429,"rank":91,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__original/img/gIhusTrYRr_2JQGEv0zuSgLtuUo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6153324.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__small/img/Ov6eWR87PZ2O1XYQtXMO6KvfzOg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6153324.jpg"],"designer":["Nigel Buckle:5864","D\u00E1vid Turczi:76227"],"artist":["Ian O\u0027Toole:64844"],"publisher":["Mindclash Games:29156","Albi:4304","CrowD Games:34522","Engames:39390","Ghenos Games:4785","Grok Games:42325","Maldito Games:30677","Portal Games:2726","Quality Beast:36831","Rozum:53490","Skellig Games:40058","Super Meeple:29409","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["Civilization:1015","Economic:1021","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113"],"mechanic":["Command Cards:2841","Cooperative Game:2023","Events:2850","Grid Movement:2676","Hand Management:2040","Hexagon Grid:2026","Modular Board:2011","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:39.7230803Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/263200/voidfall-house-reference-cards","title":"Voidfall House Reference Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/267588/voidfall-galactic-box-storage-instructions-plus-st","title":"Voidfall Galactic Box storage instructions plus storage optimization tips","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/267797/competitive-gameflow-reference-sheet","title":"Competitive gameflow reference sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/274172/icon-reference-for-double-sided-85-x11-print","title":"Icon Reference - For Double-Sided 8.5\u0022x11\u0022 Print","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/306712/voidfall-house-reference-cards-doublesided","title":"Voidfall House Reference Cards - Doublesided","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/308313/two-page-solo-reference-sheet","title":"Two Page Solo Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/293523/solo-quick-guide-setup-and-game-structure","title":"Solo Quick Guide - Setup and game structure","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/310315/house-reference-sheet","title":"House Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/276159/nigels-house-reference-cards-double-sided-85x11-pr","title":"Nigel\u0027s House Reference Cards - Double Sided 8.5x11\u0022 Print Version","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/264622/voidfall-house-reference-cards-german","title":"Voidfall House Reference Cards [german]","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":28143,"name":"Race for the Galaxy","year":2007,"description":"In Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing cards representing worlds or technical and social developments.\n\nEach round, players secretly and simultaneously select an action card corresponding to one phase of a round. These phases let players draw cards, play cards, add goods to worlds, or consume goods for VP chips. Only the phases chosen will occur that round. Every player may act in a phase that occurs, but the players who chose that phase get a bonus.\n\nGame end is triggered either when a player has built a civilization of 12 cards or when the pool of VP chips is exhausted. Each player then totals the victory points in their tableau plus any VP chips earned during play.\n\nDetailed Overview\nRace for the Galaxy tells a story of galactic discovery and expansion through a single deck of cards. Every card in the deck represents either a world that you might settle or a development that you might implement. Cards placed into your tableau represent your current achievements -- worlds you have colonized, technology you now wield -- while cards in your hand represent the options currently available to you.\n\nTo play a card, discard the number of cards equal to its cost, representing other opportunities you must forgo to concentrate on your current course. Once in your tableau, a card provides special powers during the game and, at the end, its listed number of victory points. Many worlds, once placed, also produce goods that can be traded for more cards or consumed for VP chips.\n\nRace for the Galaxy is played in rounds. In each round, you and your opponents secretly select an action phase for the upcoming turn. You can choose to:\n\u0026bull; Place a world in your tableau with settle or a development with develop.\n\u0026bull; Produce goods on worlds with produce.\n\u0026bull; Consume goods for VPs with consume.\n\u0026bull; Add cards to your hand with explore or by trading a good.\n\nEach round, only those phases that are selected will occur -- but they\u0027ll occur for everyone. Selecting a phase both ensures that it occurs that round and gains the selecting player a bonus.\n\nRound follows round until someone builds their tableau to twelve cards, or until the last VP chip is claimed. The victor is the player with the most VPs.\n\n2018 UPDATE\nThe second edition of the game is improved for CVD (color blindness) and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.\n\nUPC 655132003018\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":773794,"rank":92,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__original/img/Vh-DCkTPa8OU45LaJdUywwhiYqE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5261714.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__small/img/xLs-ldTPwaADbvzkOpF0sgWzwck=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5261714.jpg"],"designer":["Thomas Lehmann:150"],"artist":["Martin Hoffmann:11968","Claus Stephan:11902"],"publisher":["Rio Grande Games:3","ABACUSSPIELE:29","Albi:4304","Ediciones MasQueOca:24883","Feelindigo:36981","Gabinete L\u00FAdico:8500","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Gamesinitaly:9465","Ghenos Games:4785","Giochix.it:7251","Hobby Japan:1391","Hobby World:18852","Korea Boardgames:8291","Matagot:5400","Pegasus Spiele:39","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Smart Ltd:8313","Wargames Club Publishing:8759","YOKA Games:8147","Ystari Games:2861"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Civilization:1015","Economic:1021","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113"],"mechanic":["End Game Bonuses:2875","Follow:2843","Hand Management:2040","Income:2902","Market:2900","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Tags:3100","Variable Phase Order:2079"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:39.7231065Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/62287/comprehensive-rftg-reference-guide-base-plus-3-exp","title":"Comprehensive RftG Reference Guide - Base plus 3 expansions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/28797/rules-summary-v10","title":"Rules Summary v1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/82266/race-for-the-galaxy-official-riogrande-rules","title":"Race for the Galaxy - Official RioGrande Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/30431/player-reference-card","title":"Player Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/46904/race-for-kids-the-rules","title":"Race for Kids - The rules","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/64914/rftg-compact-player-aids","title":"RFTG compact player aids","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/65960/teaching-guide-for-rftg-from-the-how-to-play-podca","title":"Teaching Guide for RftG from The How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/39927/paradox-manual","title":"\u0022Paradox\u0022 Manual","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/40026/the-missing-rule-book-section-why-race-is-very-the","title":"The missing rule book section: why Race is very thematic","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/29538/race-for-the-galaxy-card-reference","title":"Race for the Galaxy Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/48832/readable-race-for-the-galaxy-rules","title":"Readable _Race for the Galaxy_ rules","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/29526/complete-card-reference","title":"Complete Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/123559/race-for-the-galaxy-comprehensive-card-reference","title":"Race for the Galaxy Comprehensive Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":157354,"name":"Five Tribes: The Djinns of Naqala","year":2014,"description":"Crossing into the Land of 1001 Nights, your caravan arrives at the fabled Sultanate of Naqala. The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!\n\nDesigned by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard \u0022worker placement\u0022 genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place \u0026ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.\n\nAs befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":40,"max_time":80,"avg_rating":77646,"rank":95,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__original/img/PS9HXrThM8Pepbd-cuA1tX8KCYU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2055255.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__small/img/I6KVJlQgS1GfWDPSWAFNqce4Cgc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2055255.jpg"],"designer":["Bruno Cathala:1727"],"artist":["Cl\u00E9ment Masson:78139"],"publisher":["Days of Wonder:1027","Arclight Games:3475","Asterion Press:15889","CrowD Games:34522","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lord of Boards:46500","Maldito Games:30677","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"],"category":["Arabian:1052","Fantasy:1010","Mythology:1082"],"mechanic":["Auction / Bidding:2012","Constrained Bidding:2922","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hidden Victory Points:2987","Mancala:2955","Modular Board:2011","Set Collection:2004","Square Grid:2940","Take That:2686","Turn Order: Auction:2827","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Victory Points as a Resource:2874"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:39.7231982Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/112557/quick-reference-card","title":"Quick Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/235401/five-tribes-rules-summary-plus-player-aid-all-expa","title":"\u003CALL IN!\u003E - Five Tribes - (Rules Summary \u002B Player Aid all expansions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/129022/five-tribes-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Five Tribes - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/160845/five-tribes-quick-rules-guide","title":"Five Tribes Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/126658/box-top-setup-instructions","title":"Box Top Setup Instructions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/112049/solitaire-rules-five-tribes","title":"Solitaire Rules - Five Tribes","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194188/five-tribes-rules-in-brief","title":"Five Tribes - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/220063/promo-djins-rules","title":"Promo Djins rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Sneak into an angry dragon\u0027s mountain lair to steal precious artifacts. Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow. Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!\n\nClank! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you\u0027ll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:\n\n\n    Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.\n    Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.\n    Boots, which are used to move around the board.\n\n\nEvery time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they\u0026rsquo;ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player\u0026rsquo;s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.\n\nDuring the game, you have two goals:\n\n    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.\n    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!\n\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":776454,"rank":97,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DPjV1iI0ygo5Bl3XLNRiIg__original/img/cXqOdM3BLyIeRt0GP3M3V--gF1M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4449526.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DPjV1iI0ygo5Bl3XLNRiIg__small/img/O2WnqJew5gNjQqPUH3gqmTBc1pQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4449526.jpg"],"designer":["Paul Dennen:92370"],"artist":["Rayph Beisner:60376","Raul Ramos:73773","Nate Storm:31001"],"publisher":["Dire Wolf:33706","Renegade Game Studios:28072","Arclight Games:3475","Conclave Editora:11043","Devir:2366","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lavka Games:34801","Lucrum Games:27470","Raven Distribution:3242","Reflexshop:36563","REXhry:21053","Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844","Tabletop KZ:55404"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Fantasy:1010"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Delayed Purchase:2901","End Game Bonuses:2875","Movement Points:2947","Open Drafting:2041","Player Elimination:2685","Point to Point Movement:2078","Push Your Luck:2661","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:39.7232685Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135153/official-clank-rulebook","title":"Official Clank!

{"bgg_id":159675,"name":"Fields of Arle","year":2014,"description":"Welcome to Arle\nIn Fields of Arle, created by Uwe Rosenberg, one to two players live as farmers in the small and peaceful town of Arle in East Frisia. The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town\u0026rsquo;s prosperity.\n\nWork the Land\nWhether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.\n\nTools of the Trade\nAt the outset of each half year, you\u0026rsquo;ll choose how you\u0026rsquo;d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal, focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock, or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and shear your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals, so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!\n\nTravel and Prosper\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods, it\u0027s time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have, the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game. Build up your farm and your vehicles and get your goods out into the world to make the most of every season. There are many roads to success in Fields of Arle, so pick your path, work the land, and enjoy the friendly competition as you strive to make your fortune!\n\n- from the publisher\u0027s website\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":2,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":802545,"rank":98,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__original/img/322N77t8F7uTev-U_WCqX5uqmEE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2225968.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__small/img/0z1o-kU2xYwmVO8oNszdt1V4K54=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2225968.png"],"designer":["Uwe Rosenberg:10"],"artist":["Dennis Lohausen:12484"],"publisher":["Feuerland Spiele:22380","999 Games:267","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Games Factory Publishing:29907","Grok Games:42325","Mandala Jogos:35035","\u30C6\u30F3\u30C7\u30A4\u30BA\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30BA (TendaysGames):22609","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Economic:1021","Farming:1013","Industry / Manufacturing:1088"],"mechanic":["Automatic Resource Growth:2903","Highest-Lowest Scoring:2889","Income:2902","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:39.7233179Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/107460/fields-of-arle-rulebook","title":"Fields of Arle - Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/204034/action-andy-fields-of-arle-complete-compact-rules","title":"ACTION ANDY - Fields Of Arle Complete Compact Rules - (EXPANSION \u0026 PROMOS - 2 players only","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/128866/4-page-gameplay-summary-for-fields-of-arle","title":"4 Page Gameplay Summary for Fields of Arle ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/191368/fields-of-arle-holistic-summary-includes-1-player","title":"Fields of Arle holistic summary (includes 1-player rules, Advent Calendar expansion, Tea \u0026 Trade, 3-player rules)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/161514/fields-of-arle-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Fields of Arle - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/272675/fields-of-arle-w-tea-and-trade-expansion-2p-setup","title":"Fields of Arle w/ Tea \u0026 Trade Expansion - 2P Setup Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace, and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts.

{"bgg_id":93,"name":"El Grande","year":1995,"description":"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king\u0027s power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\n\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\n\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king\u0027s region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.\n\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":776928,"rank":100,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RRKDHaYtFPHhczkUDcHOmg__original/img/E_QazS4f8ffj6oBcUl3C_VROCEw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7906240.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RRKDHaYtFPHhczkUDcHOmg__small/img/XPcVtsZPITv5qe3IXpzMKa5RSYA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7906240.jpg"],"designer":["Wolfgang Kramer:7","Richard Ulrich:8"],"artist":["Doris Matth\u00E4us:74","Stefan Sonnberger:56643","Franz-Georg St\u00E4mmele:145317"],"publisher":["Hans im Gl\u00FCck:133","999 Games:267","Anv\u00E4ndbart Litet F\u00F6retag:403","Descartes Editeur:41","Devir:2366","Feelindigo:36981","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Gabinete L\u00FAdico:8500","Game Harbor:12540","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Giochi Uniti:5530","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lucky Duck Games:33626","MINDOK:7992","M\u00F6bius Games:3504","Rio Grande Games:3"],"category":["Medieval:1035"],"mechanic":["Action Drafting:2838","Area Majority / Influence:2080","Auction / Bidding:2012","Hand Management:2040","Open Drafting:2041","Selection Order Bid:2926","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Take That:2686","Turn Order: Auction:2827"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:39.7233964Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/24434/el-grande-rules-summary","title":"El Grande rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/10182/new-rules-of-action-cards-confirmed-by-w-kramerpdf","title":"New rules of action cards confirmed by W.

{"bgg_id":291453,"name":"SCOUT","year":2019,"description":"SCOUT is a ladder-climbing game in which cards have two potential values, players may not rearrange their hand of cards, and players may pass their turn to take a card from the current high set of cards into their hand.\n\nMore specifically, cards are dual-indexed, with different values on each half of the card, with the 45 cards having all possible combinations of the numbers 1-10. During set-up, whoever is shuffling the cards should randomize both the order of the cards in the deck and their orientation. Once each player has been dealt their entire hand of cards, they pick up that hand without rearranging any of the cards; if they wish, they can rotate their entire hand of cards in order to use the values on the other end of each card, but again they cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hand.\n\nOn a turn, a player takes one of two actions:\n\n\u0026bull; Play: A player chooses one or more adjacent cards in their hand that have all the same value or that have values in consecutive order (whether ascending or descending), then they play this set of cards to the table. They can do this only if the table is empty (as on the first turn) or the set they\u0027re playing is ranked higher than the set currently on the table; a set is higher if it has more cards or has cards of the same value instead of consecutive cards or has a set of the same quantity and type but with higher values. In this latter case when a player overplays another set, the player captures the cards in this previous set and places them face down in front of themselves.\n\n\u0026bull; Scout: A player takes a card from either end of the set currently on the table and places it anywhere they wish in their hand in either orientation. Whoever played this previous set receives a 1 VP token as a reward for playing a set that wasn\u0027t beaten.\n\nOnce per round, a player can scout, then immediately play.\n\nWhen a player has emptied their hand of cards or all but one player have scouted instead of playing, the round ends. Players receive 1 VP for each face-down card, then subtract one point for each card in their hand (except if they were the player scouted repeatedly to end the game). Play as many rounds as the number of players, then whoever has the most points wins.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":20,"max_time":20,"avg_rating":779969,"rank":102,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cf0xxkevbwTGF3VUZymKjg__original/img/vkElrRCPJxy7Q3TH9olpq20egA4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6398727.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cf0xxkevbwTGF3VUZymKjg__small/img/NUcMdmZ3_eA1YfIwL8iRgkZKaHw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6398727.png"],"designer":["Kei Kajino (\u68B6\u91CE \u6842):116503"],"artist":["Kei Kajino (\u68B6\u91CE \u6842):116503","Rie Komatsuzaki:140525","Jun Sasaki:50009","Shohei Asaoka (\u6D45\u5CA1\u6607\u5E73):159211"],"publisher":["Oink Games:22649","One More Game!:28731","4 Kavky:52588","asmodee:157","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Gen-X Games:8351","Ghenos Games:4785","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lucrum Games:27470","Pixie Games:30034","Popcorn Games:41167"],"category":["Card Game:1002"],"mechanic":["Hand Management:2040","Ladder Climbing:2980","Score-and-Reset Game:2823"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.745251Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/248888/scout-2-player-rules-summary","title":"Scout 2 Player Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/243677/scout-rules-summary-to-fit-oink-box","title":"Scout Rules Summary to fit Oink Box","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/227063/scout-rules-2-page-summary","title":"Scout Rules - 2 page summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/277664/new-version-english-scout-rules","title":"New Version English Scout Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/271499/1-page-guide-to-hand-strength-and-turn-guide","title":"1 page guide to hand strength and turn guide ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/264898/play-with-poker-cards-rulebook-trandition-chinese","title":"Play with poker cards_Rulebook Trandition Chinese ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:\n\nThey allow a player to choose actions during the game.\nThey are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.\n\nConcordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent\u0027s moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities on the 4 different maps included with the game. When all cards have been sold from the market or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, Venus, etc.) wins the game.\n\n\n     Teams of two players each may play against each other.\n     New personality cards with the goddess Venus allow for new strategies.\n     New maps (Cyprus, Hellas, Ionium) on which to play in addition to the classic Imperium map.\n\n\nNote: This entry is for the standalone game Concordia Venus.

Players represent officials from a distant, decaying and neglectful Empire who are now free to vie for dominance whether through battle, gathering scarce resources or diplomatic intrigue. Ready yourself for dramatic twists and turns as you launch into this galactic struggle.\n\nA deck of cards in 4 suits with ranks from 1-7 (2-6 for fewer than 4 players) defines the action selection system. These cards are played in a trick-taking adjacent system to select actions, take the initiative and declare Ambitions. The 3 declared Ambitions are what will score in that deal. Timing is everything. Bad hands must be mitigated by careful card play and benefitting from other players\u0027 card play.\n\nBattles are resolved quickly with the attacker choosing their level of risk. The defenders must be prepared with adequate defensive ships and cards in their tableau.\n\nEach game contains a hundred wooden ships and agents, 18 custom engraved dice, a beautiful six-panel board, and tons of cards with over 60 pieces of unique art. The base game may be played without the optional Leaders and Lore cards (for an easier teach) or with them for a richer, fuller and asymmetric game. It is also the core of the campaign game (requiring the Blighted Reach Expansion), which provides an epic, more thematic experience.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":802271,"rank":106,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XWImAu_3RK61wbzcKboVdA__original/img/43ianMZOks7UHlZILx0VBRntOmM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8145530.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XWImAu_3RK61wbzcKboVdA__small/img/Ry-6KHwNgERWadyxs1X1_P3dMvY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8145530.png"],"designer":["Cole Wehrle:35585"],"artist":["Kyle Ferrin:65224"],"publisher":["Leder Games:25624","2Tomatoes Games:30571","CMON Global Limited:21608","CrowD Games:34522","Fox in the Box:33710","HIT Games:55324","Matagot:5400","MeepleBR:32591","Portal Games:2726","Spielworxx:15108"],"category":["Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Area Movement:2046","Campaign / Battle Card Driven:2018","Dice Rolling:2072","Die Icon Resolution:2856","Hand Management:2040","Negotiation:2915","Resource to Move:2948","Trick-taking:2009","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.7453095Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/278250/arcs-base-rulebook-final-layout-april-11-2024","title":"Arcs Base Rulebook (Final Layout) - April 11 2024","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/285702/action-card-and-ambitions-reference","title":"Action Card \u0026 Ambitions Reference","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/304778/alternate-version-arcs-lars-solo-bot-rules","title":"Alternate Version_Arcs Lars Solo Bot Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/289739/arcs-ai-rules","title":"Arcs - AI Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/290931/arcs-rules-flowchart-fan-made-reference","title":"Arcs Rules Flowchart - Fan-Made Reference","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/285454/guild-and-vox-cards-reference-sheet","title":"Guild and Vox Cards Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/306421/arcades-an-area-majority-trick-taking-game-using-t","title":"ARCADEs - An Area Majority Trick Taking Game Using the Materials of ARCs.","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/299681/bot-for-solo-game-plus-ai-cards-for-bot","title":"BOT for solo game \u002B AI cards for BOT ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/292010/arcs-rules-summary","title":"ARCS rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":62219,"name":"Dominant Species","year":2010,"description":"90,000 B.C. \u0026mdash; A great ice age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. \nDominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. \nEach player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes\u0026mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won\u0026rsquo;t last: It is indeed \u0022survival of the fittest\u0022.\nThrough wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. \nAll of this eventually leads to the end game\u0026mdash;the final ascent of the ice age\u0026mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. \nBut somebody better become dominant quickly, because it\u0026rsquo;s getting mighty cold...\n\nGame Play\nThe large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles\u0026mdash;converting them into tundra in the process\u0026mdash;as the ice age encroaches.\nThe cylindrical action pawns (or \u0022AP\u0022s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.\nGenerally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal\u0026rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or \u0022VP\u0022s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.\nThroughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the \u0022earth\u0022). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. \nWhen the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile\u0026mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":120,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":780225,"rank":109,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oeygRZntjNUJWvc8SxDfww__original/img/U-WjAGlPXS_p89z4R0V4b8IADxA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic784193.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oeygRZntjNUJWvc8SxDfww__small/img/PUmSkY6ZKL81b6YuP1U59R3VdRE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic784193.jpg"],"designer":["Chad Jensen:6331"],"artist":["Bartek J\u0119drzejewski:107323","Chad Jensen:6331","Rodger B.

In 2015, astronomers estimated a large distant planet could explain the unique orbits of dwarf planets and other objects. Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet.\n\nIn The Search for Planet X, players take on the role of astronomers who use observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.\n\nEach round, as the earth travels around the sun, players use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories, which is how players score points.\n\nAs more and more objects are found, players narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.\n\nThe Search for Planet X captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzle-y nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process. Can you be the first to find Planet X?\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":75,"avg_rating":790402,"rank":110,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NItjtztEUAKOpaTWZddu9A__original/img/fr-JmerGdiEj6r9UM7F6laogGF0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5744928.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NItjtztEUAKOpaTWZddu9A__small/img/x8YD4cAVOAbSDsZbmKgU0-WQ9wI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5744928.jpg"],"designer":["Matthew O\u0027Malley:65581","Ben Rosset:60749"],"artist":["James Masino:92957","Michael Pedro:117735"],"publisher":["Foxtrot Games:24489","Renegade Game Studios:28072","17wanzy (Yihu BG):39755","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby World:18852","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lucky Duck Games:33626","Maldito Games:30677","MeepleBR:32591","Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844","\u6570\u5BC4\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30BA (Suki Games):29154","uplay.it edizioni:17786","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Deduction:1039","Puzzle:1028","Space Exploration:1113"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Deduction:3002","End Game Bonuses:2875","Paper-and-Pencil:2055","Rondel:2813","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Turn Order: Time Track:2663"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.7453733Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/210139/the-search-for-planet-x-official-rulebook","title":"The Search for Planet X - Official Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/201876/search-for-planet-x-quick-rules-guide","title":"Search for Planet X Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/210755/the-search-for-planet-x-official-solo-rules","title":"The Search for Planet X - Official Solo Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/244550/search-for-plant-x-teaching-aid-and-reference","title":"Search for Plant X Teaching Aid and Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/202139/search-for-planet-x-solo-mode-rules","title":"Search for Planet X Solo Mode Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.\n\nVictory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":782042,"rank":111,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3piN3YX4WmBRuIvbEG2Ygg__original/img/9it-9V5tij-EnowN_pLXQgl6k7c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic236169.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3piN3YX4WmBRuIvbEG2Ygg__small/img/TDXIygWwAHKc2o90uGnnAhIa7_4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic236169.jpg"],"designer":["Vlaada Chv\u00E1til:789"],"artist":["Richard Cortes:12515","Paul Niemeyer:11997"],"publisher":["Czech Board Games:5977","Czech Games Edition:7345","DiceTree Games:23205","Eagle-Gryphon Games:597","HomoLudicus:6275","IELLO:8923","MINDOK:7992","Pegasus Spiele:39","Portal Games:2726","Raven Distribution:3242","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Wargames Club Publishing:8759"],"category":["Civilization:1015","Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Auction / Bidding:2012","Auction: Dutch:2924","Hand Management:2040","Open Drafting:2041"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.7453834Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/55064/through-the-ages-english-rulebook","title":"Through the Ages - English rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/40446/tta-setup-and-rule-aid-for-3rd-printing2nd-fred-pr","title":"TtA Setup \u0026 Rule Aid (for 3rd printing/2nd Fred printing)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/90925/through-the-ages-rules-rewrite","title":"Through the Ages Rules Rewrite","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/33098/solo-rules-against-the-barbarians","title":"Solo rules - Against the Barbarians","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/49615/toms-solo-rules","title":"Tom\u0027s solo rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/69681/tta-quick-start-guide","title":"TTA Quick Start Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/30465/fred-2-2008-errata-full-game-setup-and-rules-remin","title":"FRED 2-2008 Errata, Full Game Setup, and Rules Reminder Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/59950/through-the-ages-a-players-reference-to-the-full-g","title":"Through the Ages - a players\u0027 reference to the Full Game rules","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/55203/tta-play-aid-complete-rules-single-a4-page","title":"TtA - Play Aid - Complete rules - single A4 page","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/86040/ocr-of-the-english-rulebook","title":"OCR of the English Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/104742/1-page-solo-variant-practice-game-with-quick-setup","title":"1 Page solo variant practice game with quick setup","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/48505/through-the-ages-alternative-rules","title":"Through the Ages: Alternative Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68626/teaching-guide-for-through-the-ages-from-the-how-t","title":"Teaching Guide for Through the Ages from The How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":68448,"name":"7 Wonders","year":2010,"description":"You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.\n\n7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.\n\nIn essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you\u0027ll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you\u0027ve already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.\n\nThough the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3\u0026ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":7,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":766496,"rank":112,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/35h9Za_JvMMMtx_92kT0Jg__original/img/jt70jJDZ1y1FWJs4ZQf5FI8APVY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7149798.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/35h9Za_JvMMMtx_92kT0Jg__small/img/BUOso8b0M1aUOkU80FWlhE8uuxc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7149798.jpg"],"designer":["Antoine Bauza:9714"],"artist":["Dimitri Chappuis:62528","Miguel Coimbra:12016","Etienne Hebinger:100254","Cyril Nouvel:89045"],"publisher":["Repos Production:4384","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Asterion Press:15889","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby Japan:1391","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd:9325","NeoTroy Games:32395","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Siam Board Games:33998"],"category":["Ancient:1050","Card Game:1002","City Building:1029","Civilization:1015","Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["Closed Drafting:2984","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Melding and Splaying:2981","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Neighbor Scope:3104","Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846","Score-and-Reset Game:2823","Set Collection:2004","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Tags:3100","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.7453971Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/67657/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-7-wonders-rules-and-r","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers 7 WONDERS Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/59449/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/62296/7-wonders-rules-summary","title":"7 Wonders rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/86385/complete-7-wonders-guide-booklet","title":"Complete 7 Wonders Guide Booklet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/65773/7-wonders-reference-sheet","title":"7 Wonders Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68485/7-wonders-short-guide-game-summary","title":"7 Wonders_Short Guide_Game Summary","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/75353/symbol-reference-sheet-1-page","title":"Symbol Reference Sheet (1 page)","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/92676/7-wonders-quick-reference-card-list-and-numbers","title":"7 Wonders Quick Reference - Card List and Numbers","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/292852/7-wonder-compiled-rules-complete-edition-all-offic","title":"7 Wonder Compiled Rules Complete Edition - All Official and Unofficial* Expansions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/69866/7-wonders-rules-summary","title":"7 Wonders Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/111204/7-wonders-special-cards-guilds-and-leaders-alphabe","title":"7 Wonders: Special cards, guilds and leaders alphabetical ordered (quick) gamerules EN","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":121921,"name":"Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island","year":2012,"description":"Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a game that takes the players to a deserted island, where they\u0027ll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They\u0027ll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and \u0026ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work \u0026ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game.\n\nIn Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island you will take the role of one of four characters from the ship crew (cook, carpenter, explorer, or soldier) and work cooperatively to build a shelter, palisade, weapons, tools ,etc and do everything you can to survive. You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, and protect yourself from weather changes among other hazards.\n\nSearch for treasures. Discover mysteries. Follow goals of six different, engaging scenarios. Start by building a big pile of wood and setting it on fire to call for help, and then start new adventures.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":772629,"rank":113,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zvHPgrNb9mgkHQk-BwVemA__original/img/OUdMMPwYXTd5JIBG9skImPqa8bg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6026697.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zvHPgrNb9mgkHQk-BwVemA__small/img/QNF6GAuZ6TTeSYtrWZlWvPaIWjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6026697.jpg"],"designer":["Joanna Kijanka:117118","Ignacy Trzewiczek:4735"],"artist":["Tomasz Bentkowski:63787","Mateusz Bielski:38917","Vincent Dutrait:12130","Jerzy Ferdyn:80458","Mateusz Kopacz:80457","Mateusz Lenart:63785","Dominik Mayer:103476","Maciej Mutwil:69434","Zhao Run Quan:66798","Piotr S\u0142aby:38138","Rafa\u0142 Szyma:21002","Ignacy Trzewiczek:4735","Micha\u0142 J.

{"bgg_id":225694,"name":"Decrypto","year":2018,"description":"Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.\n\nIn more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team\u0027s four words are \u0022pig\u0022, \u0022candy\u0022, \u0022tent\u0022, and \u0022son\u0022, then I might say \u0022Sam-striped-pink\u0022 and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.\n\nStarting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, \u0022sucker-prince-stake\u0022. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they\u0027re correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)\n\nThe rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team\u0027s words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.\n\n","min_players":3,"max_players":8,"min_time":15,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":776806,"rank":115,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__original/img/lL6QJ69UmZT7CeljUcjyA47b-e0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3759421.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__small/img/O5XHaPOALYquS058qcXWVm5b_k4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3759421.jpg"],"designer":["Thomas Dagenais-Lesp\u00E9rance:82239"],"artist":["Fabien Fulchiron:102564","NILS:102563","Manuel Sanchez:102567"],"publisher":["Scorpion Masqu\u00E9:6352","2 Pionki:40920","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","asmodee:157","Enigma (Bergsala Enigma):6784","Fantasmagoria:22560","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Games4you:52408","Games7Days:48438","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","GoKids \u73A9\u6A02\u5C0F\u5B50:28415","Hachette Boardgames USA:16092","Happy Baobab:8439","IELLO:8923","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Lavka Games:34801","Lex Games:25203","Portal Games:2726","Regatul Jocurilor:44241","Salta da Caixa:50269","Well Designed Game:53618"],"category":["Deduction:1039","Party Game:1030","Spies / Secret Agents:1081","Word Game:1025"],"mechanic":["Communication Limits:2893","Paper-and-Pencil:2055","Targeted Clues:2866","Team-Based Game:2019"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.7454745Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/156950/english-rules","title":"English rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/174441/decrypto-quick-reference-cards","title":"Decrypto Quick Reference Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/195497/scoresheet-with-turn-order-and-rule-summary","title":"Scoresheet with Turn Order \u0026 Rule Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/236914/decrypto-teaching-aid-and-player-references","title":"Decrypto Teaching Aid and Player References","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/204427/decrypto-rules-summary-mattybrem","title":"Decrypto Rules Summary - MattyBrem","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":171623,"name":"The Voyages of Marco Polo","year":2015,"description":"In 1271, 17-year-old Marco Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother. After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the \u0022Silk Road\u0022, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.\n\nIn The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and take turns performing actions by placing their dice onto the board. Players may choose from a variety of actions, each require the use of one or more dice: collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts, traveling on the map or using a special action granted by a city. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.\n\nAfter five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most contracts, and having trading posts in the cities on secret goal cards that each player gets at the start of the game.\n\nThis game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":40,"max_time":100,"avg_rating":776645,"rank":116,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n1G7_aWToLAAB7Mqt8iwyA__original/img/VQddnfi_QO0r4GmUU3M8_-nuO3Q=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2461346.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n1G7_aWToLAAB7Mqt8iwyA__small/img/qfEgrXBN5L1EeMQ91siw6r_OoL4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2461346.png"],"designer":["Simone Luciani:35418","Daniele Tascini:59986"],"artist":["Dennis Lohausen:12484"],"publisher":["Hans im Gl\u00FCck:133","999 Games:267","Albi:4304","Albi Polska:46179","Arclight Games:3475","CrowD Games:34522","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Giochi Uniti:5530","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Piatnik:22","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Dice:1017","Economic:1021","Medieval:1035","Travel:1097"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Point to Point Movement:2078","Resource to Move:2948","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement with Dice Workers:2935"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.7454856Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/115658/the-voyages-of-marco-polo-english-rules-translatio","title":"The Voyages of Marco Polo - English rules translation","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132273/the-voyages-of-marco-polo-solo-variant-automa-appr","title":"The Voyages of Marco Polo - Solo Variant - \u0022Automa Approach\u0022._Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/116668/voyages-of-marco-polo-guide-3-pages","title":"Voyages of Marco Polo Guide - 3 pages","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/156152/gran-khan-fan-expansion-balanced-cards-and-charact","title":"Gran Khan Fan Expansion - Balanced Cards \u0026 Characters, Edited Rulebook, Printable Extra Boards, \u0026 More!

{"bgg_id":163068,"name":"Trickerion: Legends of Illusion","year":2015,"description":"Trickerion is a competitive Euro-style strategy game set in a fictional world inspired by the late 19th century urban life and culture, spiced with a pinch of supernatural.\n\nPlayers take on the roles of rival stage illusionists, each with their own strengths and characteristics. They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.\n\nUsing worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers \u0026mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices \u0026ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.\n\nThe tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician\u0027s own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.\n\nThe game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.\n\nThe \u0022Dark Alley\u0022 expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game. It also comes with 48 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 27 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":797032,"rank":118,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gob752VqEklQFV_gz16hw__original/img/ivQUea2qrHp2TDLM4i7gp1123vQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2585510.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gob752VqEklQFV_gz16hw__small/img/C2GPhkDu7fWK6L64MTOaYVRCgS4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2585510.png"],"designer":["Richard \u00C1mann:76971","Viktor P\u00E9ter:76578"],"artist":["Vill\u0151 Farkas:76972","L\u00E1szl\u00F3 Fejes:85502"],"publisher":["Mindclash Games:29156","APE Games:1009","Corax Games:31839","Maldito Games:30677","Super Meeple:29409","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["Post-Napoleonic:2710"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Action Queue:2689","Catch the Leader:2887","Dice Rolling:2072","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.7455165Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/108952/trickerion-english-rules","title":"Trickerion - English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/136532/trickerion-holistic-summary-includes-dark-alley-ma","title":"Trickerion holistic summary (includes Dark Alley, Magician Powers, Duel of Magicians, Dahlgaard\u0027s Academy, Dahlgaard\u0027s Heir, Dawn of Technology, Quick Start rules)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132404/trickerion-2-page-quick-reference","title":"Trickerion - 2-Page Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/212474/one-page-tricks-reference","title":"One-page Tricks Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/185277/revised-rulebook-collectors-edition","title":"Revised Rulebook - Collector\u0027s Edition","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/187497/trickerion-solo-rulebook","title":"Trickerion - Solo rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/189893/trickerion-rules-combined-dahlgaards-heir-dahlgaar","title":"Trickerion Rules - Combined Dahlgaard\u0027s Heir, Dahlgaard\u0027s Academy, and Duel of Magicians","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/236378/how-to-teach-play-learn-aid-in-3-pages-with-graphi","title":"How to Teach Play Learn Aid in 3 Pages with Graphics!","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/159893/trickerion-easy-player-guide","title":"Trickerion Easy Player Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167905/trickerion-promo-the-secret-workshop-rules","title":"Trickerion Promo: The Secret Workshop - Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/191054/rules-changes-and-setup","title":"Rules Changes \u0026 Setup","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/255377/complete-trickerion-setup-guide","title":"Complete Trickerion Setup Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Dark forces work in the shadows and call upon unspeakable horrors, strange happenings are discovered all throughout the city of Arkham, Massachusetts, and behind it all an Ancient One manipulates everything from beyond the veil.

{"bgg_id":155821,"name":"Inis","year":2016,"description":"Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:\n\n\n     Leadership: Be the leader \u0026mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player \u0026mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents\u0027 clans.\n     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.\n     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.\n\n\nAt the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect \u0022epic tales\u0022 cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions. Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, that reduce by one the total for any Victory condition.\n\nCareful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you\u0027ll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.\n\nWhile Inis has \u0022dudes\u0022 that are \u0022on a map\u0022, it\u0027s a beginner\u0027s mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan\u0027s movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan\u0027s people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan\u0027s miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":781437,"rank":120,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__original/img/6bZdn1SNbpIqU7n5pwtncvdNE_U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4739757.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__small/img/m63hnvHi6jqlva52FGaWbEqzjys=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4739757.jpg"],"designer":["Christian Martinez:6997"],"artist":["Dimitri Bielak:30958","Jim FitzPatrick:44725"],"publisher":["Matagot:5400","Bureau de Juegos:26638","Bur\u00F3:44144","Gen-X Games:8351","Giant Roc:42147","GoKids \u73A9\u6A02\u5C0F\u5B50:28415","Hid Konem (\u0425\u0456\u0434 \u041A\u043E\u043D\u0435\u043C):56118","Hobby Japan:1391","Lavka Games:34801","Lord of Boards:46500","Pegasus Spiele:39","Portal Games:2726","Surfin\u0027 Meeple:39058","Surfin\u0027 Meeple China:36763"],"category":["Ancient:1050","Card Game:1002","Exploration:1020","Mythology:1082","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Action Drafting:2838","Area Majority / Influence:2080","Area Movement:2046","Campaign / Battle Card Driven:2018","Closed Drafting:2984","Hand Management:2040","Interrupts:2837","King of the Hill:2886","Map Addition:2959","Modular Board:2011","Take That:2686","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:48.7455791Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/156203/universal-head-inis-rules-summary-and-reference","title":"Universal Head INIS Rules Summary and Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/140498/inis-rules-clarifications","title":"INIS Rules Clarifications","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/208116/solo-rules-english-rulebook","title":"Solo Rules - English Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/266424/inis-victory-conditions-reference-card","title":"INIS - Victory Conditions - Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/196447/inis-rules-in-brief","title":"Inis - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/268958/victory-condition-reference-card","title":"Victory Condition Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/228843/inis-pronounciation-guide","title":"Inis Pronounciation Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

All of them have one goal in mind: Reaching the golden border first and winning all of the riches for themselves. Whoever chooses the best tactics will be rewarded!\n\nEach player starts with a face-down deck of 8 cards\u0026mdash; his or her expedition \u0026mdash;to draw from. You start each turn with 4 cards in your hand. Use expedition cards to move through the jungle or hire more people for your expedition.

{"bgg_id":37111,"name":"Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game","year":2008,"description":"Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.\n\nAfter the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival\u0026hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?\n\nBattlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities.\n\nPlayers then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don\u0027t match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up.\n\nIf players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.\n\n","min_players":3,"max_players":6,"min_time":120,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":772999,"rank":123,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__original/img/MYuRAKLRAGlIQTph2XKWjzqT7sQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic354500.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__small/img/s1BljxEdoxQ1zGYiw05Qa9rg9hI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic354500.jpg"],"designer":["Corey Konieczka:6651"],"artist":["Kevin Childress:16531","Andrew Navaro:12018","Brian Schomburg:11989","WiL Springer:12436"],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","Edge Entertainment:2973","Editrice Giochi:253","Galakta:4617","Game Harbor:12540","Giochi Uniti:5530","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264"],"category":["Bluffing:1023","Deduction:1039","Movies / TV / Radio theme:1064","Political:1001","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113","Spies / Secret Agents:1081"],"mechanic":["Area Movement:2046","Dice Rolling:2072","Hand Management:2040","Hidden Roles:2891","Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846","Role Playing:2028","Semi-Cooperative Game:2820","Team-Based Game:2019","Traitor Game:2814","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Voting:2017"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:52.9985846Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/39029/universal-head-battlestar-galactica-rules-summary","title":"Universal Head BATTLESTAR GALACTICA Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68433/battlestar-galactica-combined-rule-book","title":"Battlestar Galactica combined rule book ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68806/battlestar-galactica-combined-rule-book-play-aid","title":"Battlestar Galactica combined rule book play aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/36609/battlestar-galactica-setup-and-quick-reference","title":"Battlestar Galactica Setup and Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/41329/crisis-card-chart","title":"Crisis Card Chart","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/43622/battlestar-galactica-rules-summary","title":"Battlestar Galactica rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/99729/battlestar-galactica-combined-rule-book-variants","title":"Battlestar Galactica combined rule book variants ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/293791/battlestar-galactica-combined-rulebook-10","title":"Battlestar Galactica combined rulebook 1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/41207/bsg-alternative-rules","title":"BSG Alternative Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/40359/character-reference-sheet","title":"Character Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

His endowments created nearly 2,500 free public libraries that bear his name: the Carnegie Libraries.\n\nDuring the game you will recruit and manage employees, expand your business, invest in real estate, produce and sell goods, and create transport chains across the United States; you may even work with important personalities of the era.

As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?\n\nThe aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game\u0027s end. Points are gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop\u0027s cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at game\u0027s end will their virtue be judged. A few underhand deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":80,"avg_rating":770978,"rank":128,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OAX7HfOz-9N60StgADzd0g__original/img/x2Y_DYWrzzleMETfnu7Jm3R8jPo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3781944.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OAX7HfOz-9N60StgADzd0g__small/img/sBMaoJ-Kz74lJ6djcl-NNMTr0Wo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3781944.png"],"designer":["S J Macdonald:103821","Shem Phillips:12547"],"artist":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski:70533"],"publisher":["Garphill Games:9459","Angry Lion Games:38809","Banana Games:35928","CMON Global Limited:21608","Fever Games:27480","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lavka Games:34801","Lord of Boards:46500","Meeple:49615","MeepleBR:32591","Mosaico Jogos:44349","Pixie Games:30034","Portal Games:2726","Primigenio:30490","Reflexshop:36563","Renegade Game Studios:28072","Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844","TLAMA games:41423","White Goblin Games:4932","Yayoi The Dreamer:42760","\u682A\u5F0F\u4F1A\u793E\u30B1\u30F3\u30D3\u30EB (KenBill):37975"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Medieval:1035"],"mechanic":["Area Movement:2046","Contracts:2912","End Game Bonuses:2875","Events:2850","Kill Steal:2871","Loans:2904","Open Drafting:2041","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Static Capture:2861","Tags:3100","Take That:2686","Track Movement:2939","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:52.9987209Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/160898/rulebook-and-appendix-for-architects","title":"Rulebook and Appendix for Architects","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180146/apprentices-and-buildings-reference","title":"Apprentices and Buildings reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/171744/printable-promo-rules-for-architects","title":"Printable Promo Rules for Architects","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/173037/quick-rule-guide-for-beginners","title":"Quick Rule Guide for Beginners","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/173470/architects-of-the-west-kingdom-quick-rules-guide","title":"Architects of the West Kingdom Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/177544/english-rules-renegade-game-studios","title":"English Rules - Renegade Game Studios","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193719/architects-of-the-west-kingdom-rules-in-brief","title":"Architects of the West Kingdom - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/172402/location-function-guide","title":"Location Function Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/188365/architects-of-the-west-kingdom-a-plain-and-simple","title":"Architects of the West Kingdom - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/266513/architects-rules-addendum","title":"Architects rules addendum","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/245346/quick-reference-variable-player-powers-buildings-a","title":"Quick reference - Variable Player Powers - Buildings - Apprentices ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":42,"name":"Tigris \u0026 Euphrates","year":1997,"description":"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia\u0027s masterpiece, Tigris \u0026 Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\n\nStarting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris \u0026 Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This \u0022ziggurat expansion\u0022, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\n\nSome versions of Tigris \u0026 Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they\u0027re for 3-4 players. Tigris \u0026 Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia\u0027s tile-laying trilogy.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":770351,"rank":129,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/t-cfSQs4Ic3SAzCSxTigLg__original/img/SfOjGBpLyPrnntZjjxrnSXmJWT4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic9203204.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/t-cfSQs4Ic3SAzCSxTigLg__small/img/S1_WOK5YsEMbw0EHwCFIN026tkM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic9203204.png"],"designer":["Reiner Knizia:2"],"artist":["Bascu:12176","Christine Conrad:26009","Doris Matth\u00E4us:74","Ian O\u0027Toole:64844","Tom Thiel:16910","Ricarda Thiel:44542","Stephen Graham Walsh:12063"],"publisher":["Hans im Gl\u00FCck:133","25th Century Games:28620","999 Games:267","CZ Cloud Soft Co.

{"bgg_id":122515,"name":"Keyflower","year":2012,"description":"Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a \u0022home\u0022 tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player\u0027s own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players\u0027 villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.\n\nIn spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.\n\nKeyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.\n\nKeyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the \u0022Key\u0022 series from R\u0026D Games set in the medieval \u0022Key\u0022 land.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":90,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":771252,"rank":130,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HbfgxDJZQnNEZQKvpmJxQg__original/img/HsrtfanhKfXX07zNEm-xZpSbxyY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2278942.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HbfgxDJZQnNEZQKvpmJxQg__small/img/5t1MtJEDdhSgtyJlmu3Hu1qR_ZQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2278942.jpg"],"designer":["Sebastian Bleasdale:7448","Richard Breese:134"],"artist":["Juliet Breese:11888","J Breese:63350","Gemma Tegelaers:64986"],"publisher":["R\u0026D Games:83","Arclight Games:3475","Czacha Games:31815","Dice Realm:46544","Ediciones MasQueOca:24883","Fabrika Igr:37681","FoxMind:1280","Game Harbor:12540","Game Salute:22701","Gigamic:155","HUCH!:3490","Quined Games:10663","Red Glove:6123","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","WoodCat:47883"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Renaissance:1070","Territory Building:1086","Transportation:1011"],"mechanic":["Auction / Bidding:2012","Auction: Fixed Placement:2931","Auction: Multiple Lot:2927","Constrained Bidding:2922","End Game Bonuses:2875","Network and Route Building:2081","Ownership:2911","Selection Order Bid:2926","Set Collection:2004","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Auction:2827","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:52.9989741Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81999/keyflower-english-rules","title":"Keyflower English rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93479/keyflower-second-edition-rules","title":"Keyflower Second edition rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/116783/keyflower-holistic-summary-includes-farmers-mercha","title":"Keyflower holistic summary (includes Farmers, Merchants, Key Celeste, Keymelequin; other promos don\u0027t affect the rules)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/207846/action-andy-keyflower-complete-compact-rules-with","title":"ACTION ANDY - Keyflower Complete Compact Rules - with Tile ref and iconography","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/85303/quick-rules-summary-and-game-management-cheat-shee","title":"Quick Rules Summary and Game Management Cheat Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/103073/rules-faq-and-clarifications","title":"rules faq and clarifications","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/129341/keyflower-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Keyflower - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/128661/keyflower-solo-play-rules-flow-chart","title":"Keyflower Solo Play Rules Flow Chart","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/174064/compilation-of-rules-for-promos-and-mini-expansion","title":"Compilation of Rules for Promos and Mini Expansions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/171208/keyflower-promo-tile-rules","title":"Keyflower Promo Tile Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/158112/keyflower-with-farmersmerchants-expansion-quick-ru","title":"Keyflower (with Farmers/Merchants Expansion) Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/199076/keyflower-rules-in-brief","title":"Keyflower - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":40834,"name":"Dominion: Intrigue","year":2009,"description":"In Dominion: Intrigue (as with Dominion), each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \u0022buy\u0022 as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.\n\nFrom the back of the box: \u0022Something\u0026rsquo;s afoot. The steward smiles at you like he has a secret, or like he thinks you have a secret, or like you think he thinks you have a secret. There are secret plots brewing, you\u0026rsquo;re sure of it. At the very least, there are yours. A passing servant murmurs, \u0026ldquo;The eggs are on the plate.\u0026rdquo; You frantically search your codebook for the translation before realizing he means that breakfast is ready. Excellent.

{"bgg_id":264220,"name":"Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon","year":2019,"description":"Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon  is an unforgettable, solo or cooperative adventure experience for 1-4 players. Blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology with a unique vision, it allows you to impact the game world in deep and meaningful ways. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike. Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.\n\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by con\uFB02ict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several con\uFB02icting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to di\uFB00erent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\n\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need to brute force your way, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each con\uFB02ict fun and exciting, while keeping you immersed in the game.\n\nIn Avalon, there\u0026rsquo;s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Many secrets can be discovered only after several games. Created by one of the best Polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":803211,"rank":132,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aAwBzPzta4joKfFZt05hCw__original/img/e1HfD3XIvObNuGH6rq7kUSK-5aQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4385726.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aAwBzPzta4joKfFZt05hCw__small/img/zvV21ZaydrMSEbbYSNXcmw3WmfY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4385726.jpg"],"designer":["Krzysztof Piskorski:42812","Marcin \u015Awierkot:106124"],"artist":["Piotr Foksowicz:39040","Piotr Gacek:114320","Patryk J\u0119draszek:113980","Ewa Labak:114786","Michael Peitsch:86660","Andrzej P\u00F3\u0142toranos:113981"],"publisher":["Awaken Realms:29412","Albi:4304","Arclight Games:3475","CrowD Games:34522","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Edge Entertainment:2973","Giochi Uniti:5530","Kilogames:32866","Maldito Games:30677","MeepleBR:32591","Pegasus Spiele:39","Summon Games:37459","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Exploration:1020","Fantasy:1010","Mature / Adult:1118","Medieval:1035","Mythology:1082","Travel:1097"],"mechanic":["Area Movement:2046","Campaign / Battle Card Driven:2018","Cooperative Game:2023","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Dice Rolling:2072","Hand Management:2040","Map Addition:2959","Modular Board:2011","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Role Playing:2028","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Storytelling:2027","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:53.0138211Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/201966/universal-head-esoteric-order-of-gamers-tainted-gr","title":"Universal Head / Esoteric Order of Gamers TAINTED GRAIL Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193526/painting-guides-beginner-friendly","title":"Painting Guides (beginner-friendly)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/188783/tainted-grail-final-rulebook","title":"Tainted Grail Final Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/191061/icon-guide-for-tainted-grail-fall-of-avalon","title":"Icon Guide for Tainted Grail--Fall of Avalon","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/192238/advancement-overview","title":"Advancement Overview","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/206172/list-of-actions-with-costs-and-easily-forgotten-ru","title":"List of actions with costs and easily forgotten rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/216540/foam-core-insert-for-tainted-grail-plus-expansions","title":"Foam Core insert for Tainted Grail \u002B Expansions","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/195570/assembly-instructions-for-arthur-resin-model","title":"Assembly Instructions for Arthur Resin Model","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/208938/how-to-put-all-cards-sleeved-in-base-box-tainted-g","title":"How to put all cards sleeved in base box Tainted Grail","language":"English","file_type":"docx"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":170042,"name":"Raiders of the North Sea","year":2015,"description":"Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age. As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it\u0027s raiding season!\n\nTo impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:\n\n\n     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.\n\n\n\n     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement \u0026mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress \u0026mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.\n\n\nThe game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":80,"avg_rating":772114,"rank":133,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hXdfAhgZ8OeyWLunt36wlw__original/img/f5wjooKB2dGPBlBzws5cDsuuJ-k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3578101.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hXdfAhgZ8OeyWLunt36wlw__small/img/vh7ttK5C_kKf5YZNYOY4vfsgXHU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3578101.jpg"],"designer":["Shem Phillips:12547"],"artist":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski:70533"],"publisher":["Garphill Games:9459","Angry Lion Games:38809","Banana Games:35928","CrowD Games:34522","Games Factory Publishing:29907","Ghenos Games:4785","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","MeepleBR:32591","MIPL:51614","Mosigra:36818","Pixie Games:30034","Primigenio:30490","Renegade Game Studios:28072","REXhry:21053","Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844","White Goblin Games:4932","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Medieval:1035","Nautical:1008"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","Hand Management:2040","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:53.0138451Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/115551/raiders-of-the-north-sea-official-rulebook","title":"Raiders of the North Sea - Official Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/158566/raiders-with-expansions-combined-rules-summary","title":"Raiders with Expansions combined rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/192814/raiders-of-the-north-sea-game-guide","title":"Raiders Of The North Sea Game Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/126265/townfolk-card-reference","title":"Townfolk Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/196150/townsfolk-reference-base-game-plus-expansions-plus","title":"Townsfolk Reference (base game \u002B expansions \u002B promos)","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253611/house-rules","title":"House Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/214191/scythian-20-rule-changes","title":"Scythian 2.0 Rule Changes","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/274887/quick-start-for-raiders-of-the-north-sea","title":"Quick Start for Raiders of the North Sea","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/198029/raiders-of-the-north-sea-plus-both-expansions-rule","title":"Raiders of the North Sea \u002B Both Expansions Rules Reference","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/202858/raiders-of-the-north-sea-plus-both-expansions-quic","title":"Raiders of the North Sea \u002B Both Expansions Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/308710/raiders-of-the-north-sea-complete-condensed-rules","title":"Raiders of the North Sea complete condensed rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":18602,"name":"Caylus","year":2005,"description":"Once upon a time ...\n1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.\n\nThe players embody master builders. By building the King\u0027s castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King\u0027s favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.\n\nEach turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.\n\nAs new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":770545,"rank":134,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yC7nOSc1x5PT-oNnh6TEcQ__original/img/ugJgRdFpYSsb5Pj1NDk76q6LKTo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1638795.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yC7nOSc1x5PT-oNnh6TEcQ__small/img/ec9AK_e7FTbxy9tA8er2wW4UnqA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1638795.jpg"],"designer":["William Attia:5629"],"artist":["Cyril Demaegd:4009","Arnaud Demaegd:12886","Mike Doyle (I):11858"],"publisher":["Ystari Games:2861","Brain Games:7162","Edge Entertainment:2973","Esdevium:531","hobbity.eu:10562","Hobby Japan:1391","HUCH!:3490","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Quined White Goblin Games:4696","Rio Grande Games:3","uplay.it edizioni:17786","What\u0027s Your Game?:4303","White Goblin Games:4932"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Medieval:1035"],"mechanic":["Action Queue:2689","Ownership:2911","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Turn Order: Pass Order:2830","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:53.0138636Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/16766/caylus-quick-rules-v2doc","title":"Caylus Quick Rules v2.doc","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/58457/teaching-guide-for-caylus-from-the-how-to-play-pod","title":"Teaching Guide for Caylus from The How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/31508/caylus-rules-as-doc-file","title":"Caylus Rules as .DOC file","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/13065/caylus-rules-12pppdf","title":"Caylus Rules 12pp.PDF","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/147970/high-quality-building-reference","title":"High Quality Building Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/78938/caylus-premium-limited-edition-buildings-reference","title":"Caylus Premium Limited Edition Buildings Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/15494/fully-condensed-rules-and-optionsdoc","title":"Fully Condensed Rules and Options.doc","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/133515/a-quantified-guide-to-caylus","title":"A Quantified Guide to Caylus","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/146473/caylus-premium-buildings-guide","title":"Caylus Premium Buildings Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/64929/rules-summary-and-game-management-cheat-sheet","title":"Rules Summary and Game Management Cheat Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/14702/caylus-rules-greekdoc","title":"Caylus_Rules_Greek.doc","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":146021,"name":"Eldritch Horror","year":2013,"description":"Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?\n\nEldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One \u0026ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.\n\nWhile the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators\u0027 personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.\n\nShould you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition \u0026ndash; or maybe you\u0027ll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a \u0022reckoning effect\u0022 which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.\n\nAll the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches.

To do so, you send your family members to different areas of town, where they can obtain many achievements. In one location, they get useful resources; in another development cards that represent newly conquered territories, sponsored buildings, influenced characters, or encouraged ventures; and somewhere else they activate the effects of their cards.\n\nFamily members are not identical. At the beginning of each round, you roll three dice to determine their value. You must choose carefully where to send your most valuable family members...\n\nYou can gain VP in several ways, and you must also pay attention to your relations with the Church. The game is divided into three periods, each formed by two rounds; at the end of each period, players must show their faith, and whoever hasn\u0027t prayed enough will suffer hard penalties.

{"bgg_id":172386,"name":"Mombasa","year":2015,"description":"In Mombasa, players acquire shares of chartered companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo and spread their trading posts throughout the African continent in order to earn the most money.\n\n\u0022As I expected, the East African Company\u0027s network of trading posts has spread far into the West. They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines. It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town. After all, it can only be to our advantage to have other irons in the fire. And when the day of reckoning comes, it will show whether our hoarding of holdings and our intransigent eagerness are worth it...\u0022\n\nMombasa is a tense Euro-style strategy game set in 19th century Africa in which players invest in four chartered companies. Using influence to help them expand across the continent improves the value of the players\u0027 shares in these companies. Players will also trade in bananas, coffee or cotton, work together with diamond merchants and ensure that the accounts are kept up to date. To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning.\n\nMombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game. Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.\n\nThe game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game. With a variety of paths to victory and double-sided company boards, each game will be a new and different challenge.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":75,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":783703,"rank":141,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VceWk5QVkgIp6rWDl5qHKQ__original/img/8lLnp9nod-NhjaoUobcZ3vvb7Mg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2611318.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VceWk5QVkgIp6rWDl5qHKQ__small/img/_4ZkvkgZey9R2OJOw_TqF426Qew=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2611318.jpg"],"designer":["Alexander Pfister:11767"],"artist":["Klemens Franz:11507","Andreas Resch:11898"],"publisher":["eggertspiele:1015","Albi:4304","Arclight Games:3475","Bright World Games:32651","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Doit Games:39751","The Game Master BV:2862","Gigamic:155","Lacerta:5812","LudoSentinel:28640","MeepleBR:32591","Pegasus Spiele:39","R\u0026R Games:105","uplay.it edizioni:17786"],"category":["Economic:1021","Post-Napoleonic:2710"],"mechanic":["Action Queue:2689","Area Majority / Influence:2080","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Hand Management:2040","Investment:2910","Open Drafting:2041","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Stock Holding:2005","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Variable Player Powers:2015","Victory Points as a Resource:2874","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:55.771988Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/125272/english-rules-of-mombasa","title":"English rules of Mombasa","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/155267/automa-variant-rulebook","title":"Automa variant (rulebook)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194388/action-andy-mombasa-complete-compact-rules","title":"ACTION ANDY - Mombasa Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/133764/mombasa-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Mombasa - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/197861/mombasa-rules-in-brief","title":"Mombasa - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/254646/mombasa-setup-and-object-quick-guide","title":"Mombasa Setup and Object quick guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":36218,"name":"Dominion","year":2008,"description":"\u0022You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.\n\nBut wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn\u0027t be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother\u0027s side, would be delighted.\u0022\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the back of the box\n\nIn Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \u0022buy\u0022 as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.\n\nDominion is not a Collectible Card Game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play\u0026mdash;leading to immense variety.\n\n\u0026mdash;user summary\n\nPart of the Dominion series.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":759746,"rank":142,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6iQpZ4XkemZP07HNCODBA__original/img/96COuakNiLRrjDLc1sM4Zxsw4WE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic394356.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6iQpZ4XkemZP07HNCODBA__small/img/B2u2ghwlmI_qsUtCwuvcbnBcIqU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic394356.jpg"],"designer":["Donald X.

{"bgg_id":163412,"name":"Patchwork","year":2014,"description":"In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons \u0026mdash; the currency/points in the game \u0026mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.\n\nOn a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch\u0027s location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You\u0027re free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn\u0027t overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player\u0027s time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent\u0027s time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.\n\nIn addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn \u0022button income\u0022: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.\n\nWhat\u0027s more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.\n\nAdditionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn\u0027t happen in every game.)\n\nWhen a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":15,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":758115,"rank":143,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xNSaIHCKr_cc7Q2rQSSJPQ__original/img/HJJdVosBV35kj8pQ6wmQMiJRhVA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic9273518.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xNSaIHCKr_cc7Q2rQSSJPQ__small/img/9Kf3YKiVIJxd_EbqJEJFdlGfj7I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic9273518.jpg"],"designer":["Uwe Rosenberg:10"],"artist":["Carrie Cantwell:160309","Klemens Franz:11507","Maya Hanisch:159088","Rex Lee:130882","Jolanta Lendzioszek:130756","Cecilia Mok:160308","Gru Tsow:130883"],"publisher":["Lookout Games:234","999 Games:267","asmodee:157","Brain Games:7162","Compaya.hu: Gamer Caf\u00E9 Kft.:14813","CrowD Games:34522","Dragonfly Publishing:46577","Funforge:8832","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","GeGe Co.

{"bgg_id":396790,"name":"Nucleum","year":2023,"description":"When Elsa von Fr\u0026uuml;hlingsfeld presented her invention to King Frederik Augustus II of Saxony, people thought it was trickery. She used the recently isolated element Uranium to heat up a jar of water and used the resulting steam to power an engine that kept the Uranium active via a process she called \u0026ldquo;atomization.\u0026rdquo; Her device, the Nucleum, ushered in a new era of energy and prosperity over the next decades. Saxony went from a minor regional power to the hub of European science and engineering. Now, a generation later, factories are still hungry for more power, demanding bigger and more Nucleums to be built, more Uranium imported from the nearby country of Bohemia, and railways and power lines built across the country to carry the tamed power of the atoms to Saxony\u0026rsquo;s great cities. Inventors, engineers, and industrialists flock to the Saxon court, vying to be the leader in this new industrial revolution.\n\nNucleum is a heavy euro board game in which players take role of industrialists trying to succeed during the economic and technological boom of 19th-century Saxony, fueled by the invention and spread of the Nucleum (a nuclear reactor).\n\nPlayers earn victory points by developing their networks, building and powering urban buildings, securing contracts, and meeting milestones (randomized endgame goals). Each player also gets unique asymmetric technologies, giving them special powers when unlocked. Gameplay is continuous; players take turns one after another with no rounds or phases.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":811841,"rank":144,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fIVUaMvbfy6GCOgfxt7xaw__original/img/dBMnuz3SrgxsDLHT6pwbQFPQBIw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7647168.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fIVUaMvbfy6GCOgfxt7xaw__small/img/jKsO4nKmtNjX5bfH7aCPeK7hsqU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7647168.jpg"],"designer":["Simone Luciani:35418","D\u00E1vid Turczi:76227"],"artist":["Andreas Resch:11898","Piotr Soko\u0142owski:123923","Zbigniew Umgelter:86237"],"publisher":["Board\u0026Dice:26630","Board Bound:58538","CMON Global Limited:21608","Cranio Creations:10768","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Giant Roc:42147","Intrafin Games:5380","Maldito Games:30677","Mosaico Jogos:44349","MTS Games:46431","Old Dawg:55187","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","\u30C6\u30F3\u30C7\u30A4\u30BA\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30BA (TendaysGames):22609","\u72D7\u5420\u706B\u8ECA:57325"],"category":["Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Action Retrieval:2839","Contracts:2912","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Income:2902","Market:2900","Network and Route Building:2081","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:55.7720615Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/266108/english-rules","title":"English rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/265510/nucleum-actions-contracts-and-milestones-quick-ref","title":"Nucleum \u2B24 Actions, Contracts \u0026 Milestones Quick Reference \u2B24 One Pager","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/266147/solo-rules","title":"Solo rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/268149/english-rules-low-ink","title":"English rules - Low Ink","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":102680,"name":"Trajan","year":2011,"description":"Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture.\n\nThe central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.\n\nAt the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.\n\nWhat are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you \u0026ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.\n\nAll game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":774396,"rank":146,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/djdeCr__iNV5rMnGnxNiaQ__original/img/-pxFp0FHDLLZK_hMT5kHG7IAQ7M=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4336095.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/djdeCr__iNV5rMnGnxNiaQ__small/img/jULoayRVuV3c8cRqKOPsf7oMO5w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4336095.png"],"designer":["Stefan Feld:4958"],"artist":["Jo Hartwig:962"],"publisher":["Ammonit Spiele:17551","Asterion Press:15889","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","DiceTree Games:23205","Evrikus:38574","FoxMind:1280","Ghenos Games:4785","Gigamic:155","Gigante Jogos:26598","HUCH!:3490","Hutter Trade GmbH \u002B Co KG:9382","Maldito Games:30677","Passport Game Studios:23296","Quined Games:10663","Renegade Game Studios:28072","\u30EA\u30B4\u30EC (rigoler):43169"],"category":["Ancient:1050"],"mechanic":["Area Movement:2046","Hand Management:2040","Mancala:2955","Open Drafting:2041","Set Collection:2004"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:55.7720857Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/73680/the-new-rules-2nd-edition-for-trajan-english-versi","title":"The new rules (2nd edition) for Trajan, english version","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/72242/trajan-rules-summaryplayer-aidpdf","title":"Trajan Rules Summary/Player Aid.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/70703/rules-english-from-ammonit-spiele","title":"Rules (English) from Ammonit Spiele","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/120285/trajan-optimus-solo-rules-for-trajan","title":"Trajan Optimus - Solo rules for Trajan.","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/199922/action-andy-trajan-complete-compact-rules","title":"ACTION ANDY - Trajan Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/78481/trajan-quick-reference","title":"Trajan Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/116734/trajan-rules-reference-player-aid","title":"Trajan - Rules Reference_Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81729/trajan-japanese-rules","title":"Trajan Japanese Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/173838/one-page-trajan-summary","title":"One Page Trajan Summary","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/301880/simple-solo-rules","title":"Simple solo rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":12493,"name":"Twilight Imperium: Third Edition","year":2005,"description":"Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.\n\nTI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The \u0027designer notes\u0027 in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of CATAN, while the \u0022Command\u0022 system cleverly improves on the \u0027oil\u0027 logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.\n\n\nPart of the Twilight Imperium Series.\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shattered Empire\n    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shards of the Throne\n\n\nRe-implemented in:\n\n    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition\n\n\n","min_players":3,"max_players":6,"min_time":180,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":778041,"rank":148,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHeQQrbauUVsvh2QF6PMog__original/img/LfjXNSzbVuSmMfcRYwGcuZwFHZo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4128153.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHeQQrbauUVsvh2QF6PMog__small/img/9dc8SjfrB38KrNsuHd_JZOXnwYk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4128153.jpg"],"designer":["Christian T.

{"bgg_id":144733,"name":"Russian Railroads","year":2013,"description":"In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.\n\nThe development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.\n\nThere are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?\n\n\nGame Summary\nEach player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:\n- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.\n- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.\n- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.\n\nThe central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:\n- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces\n- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.\n- earn 2 coins\n- take 2 temporary workers\n- jump ahead in turn order\n- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you\n\nEach round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.\n\nAfter 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":772474,"rank":149,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__original/img/EnBmUkDKSbcBusI6nVRczadYs0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1772936.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__small/img/oZkHYUMtcGVwg_gz6OjtuiD3vmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1772936.jpg"],"designer":["Helmut Ohley:2748","Leonhard \u0022Lonny\u0022 Orgler:1828"],"artist":["Martin Hoffmann:11968","Claus Stephan:11902"],"publisher":["Hans im Gl\u00FCck:133","999 Games:267","Asterion Press:15889","Bard Centrum Gier:9074","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Hobby World:18852","MINDOK:7992","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Trains:1034"],"mechanic":["End Game Bonuses:2875","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:55.772124Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/109307/mini-expansion-english-rules","title":"Mini Expansion English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/106834/russian-railroads-short-guide-game-summary","title":"Russian Railroads_Short Guide_Game Summary","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/160460/russian-railroads-quick-rules-guide","title":"Russian Railroads Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/109345/mini-expansion-rules-v2","title":"Mini Expansion Rules v2","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/136053/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/203335/russian-railroads-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Russian Railroads - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/247713/russian-railroads-how-to-playsetup-quick-ref-first","title":"Russian Railroads how to play/setup quick ref (First edition \u002B Germany \u002B America)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

We are a united company, and you\u0026rsquo;ll often find that what another supervisor does will make your job easier. Let me be clear, though, this is a competition. Our current CEO will be stepping down in three years, and the supervisor who comes out on top will take his place.\n\nOn your turn, you will either place a worker to take two actions in the ever-expanding network, launch a ship and send one of your workers to space as a pilot, or recall all your earthbound workers to collect funding bonuses. Actions include acquiring blueprints, constructing ships, attracting guests, and building developments\u0026ndash;connections between locations that increase action selection throughout the game. You will also be affecting resource markets that ebb and flow with the actions of all the players.\n\nThroughout the game, you will also be competing with your fellow supervisors to complete company goals, which will earn you progress cubes throughout the game. Progress cubes are also placed when you launch ships, and when a certain number of cubes are placed onto the company\u0026rsquo;s progress track, the game ends, and the player with the most Victory Points becomes the new CEO of Galactic Cruise.\n\nDo you still think you have what it takes to work for us?

{"bgg_id":205896,"name":"Rising Sun","year":2018,"description":"The great and forgotten Kami have returned from the underworld, displeased with the affairs of the Empire\u0026rsquo;s present Sh\u014Dgun. At the start of spring in the Great New Year, the Kami have gathered their sacred clans with one quest: reclaim the lands of Nippon and return them to their honorable, spiritual traditions. However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces. Alliances must be forged, betrayal is inevitable, honorable standing rises and falls. Political mandates must be navigated and devastating war must be fought, each won by expert skill and cunning negotiation. And only one may stand victorious at the coming of winter. You, honorable Sh\u014Dgun, lead one of these great clans. Do you have the strength of honor, virtue, and spirit, as well as the mastery of steel necessary to deliver on this ancient promise?\n\nRising  Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan. Each player chooses a Clan and competes to lead theirs to victory by accumulating Victory Points over the course of the Seasons. Each Clan possesses a unique ability and differs in Seasonal Income, Starting Honor Rank, and Home Province.\nOver the course of the game, players will forge and break alliances, choose political actions, worship the gods, customize their clans, and position their figures around Japan. In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world. But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins.\n\nIn Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause. Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.\nVictory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan.\n\nThe game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner. \nEach Season is divided into five phases: \n1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, \n2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, \n3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,\n4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and \n5) Seasonal Cleanup.\n\nAs already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game. Peace falls over the land as it gets covered in white snow, and a new Emperor will rise under the power of the great Kami.\n\n","min_players":3,"max_players":5,"min_time":90,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":775442,"rank":152,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__original/img/pKJ1XyLN4hvHim5eRj2VJHijv1E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3880340.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__small/img/UNKv6MWzJUAwhhP7-ng6HoinRa8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3880340.jpg"],"designer":["Eric M.

{"bgg_id":325494,"name":"ISS Vanguard","year":2022,"description":"ISS Vanguard is a 1-4 player co-operative campaign Board Game. It will bring players right into epic Sci-Fi adventure, as they will play as 4 sections (security, recon, science, engineering) onboard the first human ship with the potential to reach outer space.  The campaign will introduce the unique story written by Krzysztof Piskorski (Tainted Grail) full of hard player choices, twists and branching storylines. The game comes with over 100 different Crew members, each with unique characteristics.\n\nA game session takes you through a Ship Management phase (using a large binder with printed sleeves) in which you choose your destination for your ship then research technologies, produce equipment, recruit crewmembers and resolve situations, and then commence a Planetary Exploration phase. During said Planetary Exploration phase you will proceed with a daring landing procedure with your Lander, explore the planet for information or resources, fighting back a barrage of threats as well as a running timer of supplies depletion before you have to run back to the Lander to lift off back to ISS Vanguard. What follows is the remainder of the Ship Management phase, which takes you through unloading discoveries and resources from the Lander, healing or memorialising crewmembers and taking apart the game board and recording changes to the planet on which you\u0027ve just conducted your Planetary Exploration on, preserving its status for when you will want or need to return to it.\n\nThe Ship Management phase works allows players to make strategic decisions as to their resources and a way forward in the unknown galaxy chasing the mystery encoded in human\u0027s DNA. The Planetary Exploration draws the focus to the tactical, as players decide on cards, dice, crewmembers and equipment to bring to fulfill dice checks on the planet\u0027s Places of Interest. The players also decide which of the variety of specialised Landers they want to use and how to outfit their Lander for the perilous descent into the chosen planet\u0027s atmosphere (or lack thereof). Throughout the game, the narrative system relies on a web of structured and linked Mission Logs, often snippets of journal entries or dialogue, to provide gameplay choices and storyline information as well as keep track of progress throughout the universe.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":837775,"rank":157,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ySeZNVkVwTvqykMGtHFFQ__original/img/WMa7R2ViiGzzWpKWEdJAOv518PU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7245199.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ySeZNVkVwTvqykMGtHFFQ__small/img/pXp7JQo64YalithQyDM7tufyasA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7245199.jpg"],"designer":["Andrzej Betkiewicz:121682","Krzysztof Piskorski:42812","Pawe\u0142 Samborski:113979","Marcin \u015Awierkot:106124"],"artist":["Piotr Gacek:114320","Patryk J\u0119draszek:113980","Ewa Labak:114786","Dominik Mayer:103476"],"publisher":["Awaken Realms:29412","Albi:4304","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","MeepleBR:32591","Pegasus Spiele:39","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Exploration:1020","Novel-based:1093","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113"],"mechanic":["Cooperative Game:2023","Dice Rolling:2072","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Open Drafting:2041","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Storytelling:2027","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:55.7722342Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/248245/iss-vanguard-complete-rules-summary","title":"ISS Vanguard Complete Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/249863/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-iss-vanguard-rules-an","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers ISS VANGUARD Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/248564/iss-vanguard-game-cycle-reference-sheet","title":"ISS Vanguard Game Cycle Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/247222/quick-reference-dice-sheet","title":"Quick reference dice sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/256751/iss-vanguard-house-rules-en","title":"ISS Vanguard House Rules (EN)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/314391/kayteems-rules-summary-for-iss-vanguard","title":"KayTeEm\u0027s Rules Summary for ISS Vanguard","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":175155,"name":"Forbidden Stars","year":2015,"description":"The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.\n\nForbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same \u0026mdash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes \u0026mdash; or they will do the same to you.\n\nEach round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:\n\n\n     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources\n     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities\n     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units\n     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.\n\n\nThe last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.\n\nBecause of the game\u0027s three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game\u0027s set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game\u0027s four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force\u0027s strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":798181,"rank":158,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__original/img/AQ1P6PKw7ZW-XTOAFKhCwsnfP0I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2471359.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__small/img/cudczHrJs0wFKywIHBQ6Fb7D7oY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2471359.jpg"],"designer":["Samuel Bailey:71982","James Kniffen:64445","Corey Konieczka:6651"],"artist":[],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","Asterion Press:15889","Edge Entertainment:2973","Galakta:4617","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264"],"category":["Bluffing:1023","Fighting:1046","Science Fiction:1016","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Area Movement:2046","Card Play Conflict Resolution:2857","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Dice Rolling:2072","Hand Management:2040","Modular Board:2011","Order Counters:2844","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:55.7722501Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/121757/universal-head-esoteric-order-of-gamers-forbidden","title":"Universal Head / Esoteric Order of Gamers FORBIDDEN STARS Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/119270/forbidden-stars-rules-summary-with-missed-rules-ru","title":"Forbidden Stars Rules Summary with Missed Rules / Rules Gotchas","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/119147/forbidden-stars-asset-reference-card","title":"Forbidden Stars Asset Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150604/mhs2-fs-house-rules","title":"MHS2 FS House Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/149147/forbidden-stars-quick-rules","title":"Forbidden Stars - Quick Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150681/player-reference-sheets-designed-to-fit-in-plano-3","title":"Player reference sheets designed to fit in Plano 3500 boxes","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131087/fs-factions-reference-sheet","title":"FS Factions Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/230966/forbidden-stars-player-aid","title":"FORBIDDEN STARS Player Aid ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167277/additional-rules-to-balance-out-the-setup-and-plan","title":"Additional rules to balance out the setup and planning phases","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

In a land fraught with danger and wonders, you have to use every ounce of wit and cunning to survive, crafting tools, weapons, and shelter to ensure your survival.\n\nUnlike most board games, it will take you many, MANY hours of exploring and searching the seventh continent until you eventually discover how to remove the curse(s)...or die trying.\n\nThe 7th Continent features an easy saving system so that you can stop playing at any time and resume your adventure later on, just like in a video game!\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":5,"max_time":1000,"avg_rating":773725,"rank":162,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OYne8uBCHv5oEgRfpOrV0A__original/img/jcTlhpYG2496xQtuQ277bFTIldY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2648303.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OYne8uBCHv5oEgRfpOrV0A__small/img/_YPdmxegKIoZI_ButuMJzfw9UBo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2648303.jpg"],"designer":["Ludovic Roudy:51255","Bruno Sautter:51055"],"artist":["Ludovic Roudy:51255"],"publisher":["Serious Poulp:17654"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Card Game:1002","Exploration:1020","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Area Movement:2046","Cooperative Game:2023","Hand Management:2040","Map Addition:2959","Modular Board:2011","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Storytelling:2027","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:59.2398506Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/122779/the-7th-continent-rulebook-kickstarter-alpha-versi","title":"The 7th Continent: Rulebook (Kickstarter Alpha version)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/159152/gps-guide-huge-spoiler","title":"\u0022GPS Guide\u0022 Huge spoiler","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player\u0027s deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents\u0027 troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your \u0022inner circle\u0022, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.\n\nWhen you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.\n\nA central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.\n\nPlayers gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":791033,"rank":163,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F58jczp5xk9CYFimrytXaw__original/img/m0S3T9_YWM7VvTW1c3pl4tBiu2c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2801874.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F58jczp5xk9CYFimrytXaw__small/img/X2ur4XNMdPRURbaziJ8nQmioNGE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2801874.jpg"],"designer":["Peter Lee:15913","Rodney Thompson:13261","Andrew Veen:27343"],"artist":["Rob Alexander:14753","Alex Aparin:30957","Daren Bader:13948","John-Paul Balmet:78057","Eric Belisle:19626","Sam Burley:43072","Milivoj Ceran:32997","Conceptopolis:41339","Katie Dillon:76681","Julie Dillon:14839","Olga Drebas:76835","Jesper Ejsing:11994","Steve Ellis (I):9234","Wayne England:14937","Jason Engle:14611","Emily Fiegenschuh:14938","Lars Grant-West:14947","Brian Hagan:14939","Todd Harris:18780","Ilich Henriquez:36622","Rick Hershey:14055","Ralph Horsley:14202","Tyler Jacobson:28288","Tomasz Jedruszek:12019","Jason Juta:14590","McLean Kendree:18117","Vance Kovacs:17763","Guido Kuip:43387","Howard Lyon:15368","Damien Mammoliti:38179","S\u0142awomir Maniak:17057","Jacob Masbruch:14275","Marcel Mercado:72736","Marco Nelor:14316","Jim Nelson:47312","William O\u0027Connor:13976","H\u00E9ctor Ortiz:19628","Ryan Pancoast:14317","Adam Paquette:24268","Klaus Pillon (I):68691","Claudio Pozas:15291","Aaron J.

In a show of Roman might, he ordered a wall to be built that would separate the Pict tribes from the rest of England. Grand in its design, the wall stretched 80 Roman miles, from coast to coast. Hadrian\u0027s Wall stood in service to the Roman Empire for nearly 300 years before its eventual decline. Today, Hadrian\u0027s Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the remains of the forts, towers, and turrets can still be explored.\n\nIn Hadrian\u0027s Wall, players take on the role of a Roman General placed in charge of the construction of a milecastle and bordering wall. Over six years (rounds), players will construct their fort and wall, man the defenses, and attract civilians by building services and providing entertainment \u0026mdash; all while defending the honor of the Roman Empire from the warring Picts. The player who can accumulate the most renown, piety, valor and discipline, whilst avoiding disdain, will prove to the Emperor they are the model Roman citizen and be crowned Legatus Legionis!\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":6,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":788134,"rank":166,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4XzRDw3VrgNpNfZlzZl66w__original/img/SfU1sNqUtpcvhcdzspDb5M9uSQQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5608818.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4XzRDw3VrgNpNfZlzZl66w__small/img/dGMBL60RMtAfcx741phN75mqlnA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5608818.png"],"designer":["Bobby Hill:103500"],"artist":["Sam Phillips:14403"],"publisher":["Garphill Games:9459","Arclight Games:3475","CMON Global Limited:21608","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lavka Games:34801","Lord of Boards:46500","Meeple:49615","Mosaico Jogos:44349","Pixie Games:30034","Portal Games:2726","Primigenio:30490","Reflexshop:36563","Renegade Game Studios:28072","Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844","TLAMA games:41423","\u76D2\u62CD\u5DE5\u4F5C\u5BA4 Hepa Studio:54777"],"category":["Ancient:1050","City Building:1029"],"mechanic":["Hand Management:2040","Paper-and-Pencil:2055","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:59.2399143Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/218594/hadrians-wall-english-rulebook","title":"Hadrian\u0027s Wall - English Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/278938/hadrians-wall-visual-player-reference","title":"Hadrian\u0027s Wall Visual Player Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/273392/hadrians-wall-reference-guide-1-2-players","title":"Hadrian\u0027s Wall - Reference Guide (1 - 2 Players)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":463,"name":"Magic: The Gathering","year":1993,"description":"\n\n\n    \n        GAME SYSTEM\n\n    \n    \n         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\nFrom the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker\u0026mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.\n\nThis is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.\n\nPlayers build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent\u0027s deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent\u0027s life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent\u0027s life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.\n\nAn important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck!\n\nCards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.\n\nPlayers randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called \u0022the stack,\u0022 provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.\n\nThough traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":20,"max_time":20,"avg_rating":759458,"rank":167,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__original/img/TKQgvl_i6zVYld8Gac8oU-c2ezE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic163749.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__small/img/TtlQgYxLTPyYQWJvruMHfwKPReE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic163749.jpg"],"designer":["Richard Garfield:14"],"artist":["Victor Adame:76846","Miao Aili:40174","Randis Albion:41753","Rob Alexander:14753","James Allen (I):49922","Dave Allsop:13924","Scott Altmann:16448","Ian Edward Ameling:49894","Eric David Anderson:13376","Chris J.

{"bgg_id":30549,"name":"Pandemic","year":2008,"description":"In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\n\nThe game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases\u0027 activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \u0022normal\u0022 spread of the infections.\n\nTaking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists\u0027 strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five\u0026mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!\n\nThe 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters\u0026mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist\u0026mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.\n\nPandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":45,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":751632,"rank":169,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__original/img/IsrvRLpUV1TEyZsO5rC-btXaPz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1534148.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__small/img/oqViRj6nVxK3m36NluTxU1PZkrk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1534148.jpg"],"designer":["Matt Leacock:378"],"artist":["Josh Cappel:9731","Christian Hanisch:33088","R\u00E9gis Moulun:11935","Chris Quilliams:14057","Tom Thiel:16910"],"publisher":["Z-Man Games:538","(Unknown):3320","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Albi:4304","Asterion Press:15889","Boardgame Space:34501","Brain Games:7162","CoolPlay:50696","Devir:2366","Enigma (Bergsala Enigma):6784","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Game Harbor:12540","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","HaKubia:23382","Hobby Japan:1391","HomoLudicus:6275","Jolly Thinkers:15983","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lacerta:5812","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd:9325","MINDOK:7992","NeoTroy Games:32395","Nordic Games ehf:44407","Paladium Games:29085","Pegasus Spiele:39","Quined White Goblin Games:4696","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Siam Board Games:33998","Stratelibri:3888","Wargames Club Publishing:8759","White Goblin Games:4932","Zhiyanjia:35809","\u0412\u0437\u0440\u043E\u0441\u043B\u044B\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438:10739","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Medical:2145","Travel:1097"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Chaining:2956","Contracts:2912","Cooperative Game:2023","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Point to Point Movement:2078","Set Collection:2004","Simulation:2070","Tags:3100","Trading:2008","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:59.240161Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/33375/universal-head-pandemic-rules-summary","title":"Universal Head PANDEMIC Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/27536/pandemic-rules-with-permission-from-z-man-games","title":"Pandemic Rules (with permission from Z-Man Games)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/43807/threat-level-six-rules-for-custom-expansion","title":"Threat Level Six (rules for custom expansion)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/31306/pandemic-quick-reference","title":"Pandemic Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/52035/end-day-rules","title":"End Day rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/143538/pandemic-expansion-guide","title":"Pandemic expansion guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/33653/bioterrorist-variant-pdf-rules-v09","title":"Bioterrorist Variant PDF rules v0.9","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/76953/pandemic-short-guide-game-summary","title":"Pandemic_Short Guide_Game Summary","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/69567/pandemic-morbidity-pocketmod-rules","title":"Pandemic: Morbidity (pocketmod rules)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

We have discovered a series of planets and sent our rovers to test their environment with the hope of colonization. Our rovers have confirmed 1-6 viable colonization options.\n\nPlanet Unknown is a competitive game for 1-6 players in which players attempt to develop the best planet. Each round, each player places one polyomino-shaped, dual-resource tile on their planet. Each resource represents the infrastructure needed to support life on the planet.

{"bgg_id":118048,"name":"Targi","year":2012,"description":"Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the \u0026lsquo;Imascheren\u0026rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.\n\nThe board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent\u0027s meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.\n\nThe game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.\n\nThe display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).\n\nThe winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":60,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":759079,"rank":171,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wHg4fOf48cs1kw1PDOk1tQ__original/img/St4ABQhpauYiq4Mt6-f38JtLOjM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3958793.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wHg4fOf48cs1kw1PDOk1tQ__small/img/6l-jqYlfECK1SVSsUs7FXUheKzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3958793.jpg"],"designer":["Andreas Steiger:57305"],"artist":["Taira Akitsu:81981","Franz Vohwinkel:11883"],"publisher":["KOSMOS:37","999 Games:267","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Galakta:4617","Giochi Uniti:5530","Group SNE:1386","IELLO:8923","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Stupor Mundi:9235","Thames \u0026 Kosmos:60627","White Goblin Games:4932","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Arabian:1052","Card Game:1002"],"mechanic":["End Game Bonuses:2875","Modular Board:2011","Open Drafting:2041","Set Collection:2004","Square Grid:2940","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:59.2402042Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/147675/targi-solo-variant-made-by-the-author","title":"Targi Solo variant made by the author","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/79363/targi-english-translation-of-the-rules-with-graphi","title":"Targi English translation of the rules with graphics","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/147573/targi-solo-rules-translation-unofficial","title":"Targi Solo - Rules Translation (unofficial)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/103064/targi-rules-summary-1-pager","title":"Targi - Rules Summary (1 pager)","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/172323/targi-straightforward-rules-in-english","title":"Targi Straightforward Rules in English","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/205392/targi-reference-cards-expansion-too","title":"Targi Reference Cards (Expansion too!)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/141818/targi-rules-summary-player-aid","title":"Targi Rules Summary / Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/116001/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike.\n\nEach trail represents one season of the year, and each season, the trails will change and grow steadily longer. The trails, represented by tiles, get shuffled in between each season and laid out anew for the next round. Resources can be tough to come by especially when someone is at the place you\u0026rsquo;re trying to reach! Campfires allow you to share a space and time with other hikers. Canteens and Gear can also be used to improve your access to resources through the game.

{"bgg_id":147020,"name":"Star Realms","year":2014,"description":"Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer). It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the speed and interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. In Star Realms, players make use of Ships and Bases to generate Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases or to generate Combat to attack their opponent to reduce their Authority or destroy their Bases. When you reduce your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Authority to zero, you win!\n\nThe Ships and Bases in Star Realms come in four factions. You may acquire and use cards of any faction, but many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using cards of the same faction together. As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you play a Ship, you do what it says and then place it into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you play a Base, you place it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it\u0026rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Authority directly.\n\nStar Realms is easy to learn, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent\u0026rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you\u0026rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn\u0026rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.\n\nThe Star Realms set contains everything you need for two players. Including multiple copies (one copy for every two players) of the game and/or its standalone expansions, Star Realms: Colony Wars and Star Realms: Frontiers, allows up to six players to play a variety of multiplayer formats, including free-for-all and team play.\n\nThis is the first game of the Star Realms series.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":20,"max_time":20,"avg_rating":755284,"rank":173,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EsJqPL5CB_TMt0MYL-lnVg__original/img/QXgamCDRuBoRJyU1PQjeh58Pvr8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1903816.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EsJqPL5CB_TMt0MYL-lnVg__small/img/s_CE1b1XXUnYj9auTPhLrvkNsYA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1903816.jpg"],"designer":["Robert Dougherty:4113","Darwin Kastle:4059"],"artist":["Randy Delven:92582","Kalissa Fitzgerald:158166","Vito Gesualdi:92581","Graphics Manufacture:137708","Cody Jones:63969","Andres Martinez:100527"],"publisher":["Wise Wizard Games:26542","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","ADC Blackfire Entertainment GmbH:29087","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Devir:2366","Games Factory:35960","Games Factory Publishing:29907","Hobby World:18852","IELLO:8923","IUVI Games:42043","NeoTroy Games:32395"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Fighting:1046","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Delayed Purchase:2901","Hand Management:2040","Income:2902","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Open Drafting:2041","Player Elimination:2685","Set Collection:2004","Tags:3100","Take That:2686","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:59.2402286Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/110169/1-page-condensed-rules","title":"1 page condensed rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/170565/official-rules-for-star-realms","title":"Official Rules for Star Realms","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/231348/star-realms-rules-cards-for-less-luck-more-control","title":"Star Realms Rules cards for Less Luck, More Control \u0026 Event Deck variants and Rules Template","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/141908/star-realms-card-rules-template","title":"Star Realms - Card Rules Template","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":161970,"name":"Alchemists","year":2014,"description":"In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories \u0026ndash; correct theories, that is \u0026mdash; and therein lies the problem.\n\nThe game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.\nPlayers declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there\u0027s academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don\u0027t want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.\n\nDuring play, players\u0027 reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nFlavor text:\nMandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad \u0026mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist\u0027s livelihood, science, and art.\n\nBut what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects \u0026mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist\u0027s cauldron.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":763687,"rank":175,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__original/img/SP4ItZ27dLweUPbz_bF7C-P7GtA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2241156.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__small/img/-a0oJ_E49V_7PDW78W7KIyS3rF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2241156.png"],"designer":["Mat\u00FA\u0161 Kotry:75718"],"artist":["David Cochard:12692"],"publisher":["Czech Games Edition:7345","Arclight Games:3475","Cranio Creations:10768","Devir:2366","DiceTree Games:23205","GaGa Games:29194","The Game Master BV:2862","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","IELLO:8923","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lex Games:25203","Lord of Boards:46500","MINDOK:7992","One Moment Games:30552","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"],"category":["Deduction:1039","Fantasy:1010","Puzzle:1028"],"mechanic":["Action Queue:2689","Constrained Bidding:2922","Deduction:3002","End Game Bonuses:2875","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040","Open Drafting:2041","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:45:59.2402795Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/108729/alchemists-rulebook-english","title":"Alchemists rulebook - English","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/117913/quick-reference","title":"Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/117918/solo-rules","title":"Solo Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/126743/box-top-liner-setup-instructions","title":"Box Top Liner Setup Instructions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/109709/alchemists-round-guide-apprentice","title":"Alchemists round guide (apprentice)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/118782/alchemist-manual-card-reader-wheel","title":"Alchemist Manual Card Reader Wheel","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/165948/tuckboxes-for-alchemists-with-setup-instructions","title":"Tuckboxes for Alchemists with setup instructions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":14996,"name":"Ticket to Ride: Europe","year":2005,"description":"Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a new train adventure across Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you\u0027ll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.\n\nMore than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent\u0027s route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.\n\nThe overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nCopyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc.\n\nPart of the Ticket to Ride series.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":752482,"rank":176,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0K1AOciqlMVUWFPLTJSiww__original/img/O37sCRSJLq4S8EpCxFDNVsNBuxE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic66668.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0K1AOciqlMVUWFPLTJSiww__small/img/RDvu2FvsYVVH8icp1VsilUlqUGI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic66668.jpg"],"designer":["Alan R.

{"bgg_id":209418,"name":"Dominion (Second Edition)","year":2016,"description":"\u0022You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.\n\n\u0022But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn\u0027t be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother\u0027s side, would be delighted.\u0027\u0022\u0027\n\nIn Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \u0022buy\u0022 as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.\n\nDominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play\u0026mdash;leading to immense variety.\n\nDominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card. These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (\u0022you may\u0022 added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).\n\nDominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":782304,"rank":179,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4dmyKfqQm_uxA1-chh4JeQ__original/img/5UxDHPldIiCb0uovIwzngR-jx5M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3187001.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4dmyKfqQm_uxA1-chh4JeQ__small/img/Td5CxjO0ZTIbwHNhk2ETEy1qYyg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3187001.jpg"],"designer":["Donald X.

{"bgg_id":77423,"name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game","year":2011,"description":"The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with up to three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players\u0027 options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.\n\nThe core set contains three scenarios, twelve famous heroes from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor, and \u0026Eacute;owyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances of success and to explore new strategies. Additionally, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a Living Card Game with over ten years of content, and much of its content has been re-released in the form of Campaign and Hero Expansions. Campaign Expansions contain new scenarios for players to embark upon, and Hero Expansions contain new heroes and new cards for players to use in their decks. (Older products include Deluxe Expansions, each containing two heroes, three quests and a medium-sized number of new player cards, and Adventure Packs, each containing one hero, one quest that continues the story started in a Deluxe Expansion and a small number of new player cards.)\n\nAlthough this game is set in Tolkien\u0027s Middle-earth, most scenarios in the game do not represent scenes from The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings; rather, they are set in the seventeen years from Bilbo\u0027s 111th birthday until Frodo\u0027s departure from the Shire, allowing players to create their own stories and adventures in Middle-earth. Scenarios from the game\u0027s Saga Expansions do follow the events of the books, and can be played not only individually but also together in sequence as a campaign, with lasting consequences from game to game arising from the players\u0027 actions and decisions.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":2,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":76605,"rank":184,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZmXi5BbtoWl58ZnKcUy1vw__original/img/nNHf1qRJCVQx_0p-1zM8QKxcywo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic906495.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZmXi5BbtoWl58ZnKcUy1vw__small/img/__NGanznvqHKTFhj28S8ZpfLbpc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic906495.jpg"],"designer":["Nate French:11655"],"artist":["Even Mehl Amundsen:40598","Erfian Asafat:43501","Tiziano Baracchi:19822","Ryan Barger:12438","Sara Biddle:29339","Yoann Boissonnet:29340","Leonardo Borazio:14879","Noah Bradley:50887","Marco Caradonna:29341","Kevin Childress:16531","Anna Christenson:29343","West Clendinning:43386","Nicholas Cloister:36004","Soul Core:49392","Daarken:12511","Katherine  Dinger:48519","Loren Fetterman:34766","Tony Foti:43532","Tom Garden:14272","Kristina Gehrmann:49390","Lucas Graciano:20339","Margaret Hardy:50050","Jeff Himmelman:14593","David Horne:26040","Christopher Hosch:50786","Ijur:49389","Dominik Kasprzycki:75217","Kaya:59153","Igor Kieryluk:15935","Mathias Kollros:14110","Lius Lasahido:48498","David Lecossu:49383","Henning Ludvigsen:24858","Daryl Mandryk:35573","David Auden Nash:49382","Mike Nash:19549","Winona Nelson:49388","Andrew Olson:39085","Gabrielle Portal:49387","Rio Sabda:49391","Alexandru Sabo:49381","Amanda Sartor:19691","Marc Scheff:42152","Alexandr Shaldin:49386","WiL Springer:12436","John Stanko:19631","Matthew Starbuck:41678","Florian Stitz:21149","Nikolay Stoyanov:49384","Angela Sung:49393","Sandara Tang:36620","Fredrik Tyskerud:21098","Santiago Villa:49385","Magali Villeneuve:29809","Frank Walls:17928","Jason Ward:43509","Drew Whitmore:50051","John Wigley:16398","Mark Winters:29350","Jen Zee:36525","Ben Zweifel:49280"],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Edge Entertainment:2973","Galakta:4617","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Game Harbor:12540","Giochi Uniti:5530","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Stratelibri:3888"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Card Game:1002","Collectible Components:1044","Fantasy:1010","Novel-based:1093"],"mechanic":["Cooperative Game:2023","Deck Construction:3004","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040","Player Elimination:2685","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:02.1170209Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/67464/universal-head-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game","title":"Universal Head THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE CARD GAME Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66894/comprehensive-card-reference-and-unofficial-faq","title":"Comprehensive Card Reference \u0026 Unofficial FAQ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66624/clarified-turn-sequence-and-quick-reference-w-faqs","title":"Clarified Turn Sequence and Quick Reference w/ FAQs","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/116238/the-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-turn-reference-by-ryno","title":"The Lord of the Rings LCG Turn Reference By Ryno","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/97013/geckoths-rulesheet-insert-cards","title":"GeckoTH\u0027s Rulesheet Insert Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93213/lotr-rule-summary-and-teaching-aid","title":"LotR - Rule Summary \u0026 Teaching Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/92032/adventure-pack-inserts-and-keywords","title":"Adventure Pack Inserts and Keywords","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":34635,"name":"Stone Age","year":2008,"description":"The \u0022Stone Age\u0022 times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.\n\nIn Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.\n\nPlayers use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players take turns placing their tribe members in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, each player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, in turn order. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":751213,"rank":185,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/elmZegVZ6gp4_5izUgxGQQ__original/img/cR92Dm6yQ3Lgxt1yR81zUb0ooqQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1632539.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/elmZegVZ6gp4_5izUgxGQQ__small/img/MXq3DEKWIozO-PmB4S64BiE5fd0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1632539.jpg"],"designer":["Bernd Brunnhofer:928"],"artist":["Michael Menzel:11825"],"publisher":["Hans im Gl\u00FCck:133","999 Games:267","asmodee:157","Bard Centrum Gier:9074","Boardgame Space:34501","Devir:2366","Feelindigo:36981","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Giochi Uniti:5530","HaKubia:23382","Hobby World:18852","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lanlalen:36210","Lautapelit.fi:3218","MINDOK:7992","M\u00F6bius Games:3504","Oxygame:694","Piatnik:22","Rio Grande Games:3","Schmidt Spiele:38","Stupor Mundi:9235","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Z-Man Games:538","Zvezda:1466"],"category":["Dice:1017","Economic:1021","Prehistoric:1036"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Set Collection:2004","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:02.118724Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/33172/stone-age-quick-reference","title":"Stone Age Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/82269/stone-age-official-rio-grande-games-rules","title":"Stone Age - Official Rio Grande Games Rules.","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/57869/stone-age-short-guide-game-summary","title":"Stone Age_Short Guide_Game Summary","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/62195/teaching-guide-for-stone-age-from-the-how-to-play","title":"Teaching Guide for Stone Age from The How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/59641/stone-age-how-to-score-learning-reference","title":"Stone Age - How to score - learning reference ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/191451/event-cards-revamped-and-extended-final-version-wi","title":"Event Cards, revamped and extended - final version with rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/82485/rules-summary-quality-1-page-by-daxon","title":"Rules Summary (Quality, 1 Page) by Daxon","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/257768/official-solo-rules-pdf","title":"Official Solo Rules PDF","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/50938/stone-age-reference-card","title":"Stone Age Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/192316/stone-age-game-guide","title":"Stone Age Game Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/152131/stone-age-rules-for-tribal-warfare","title":"Stone Age - Rules for Tribal Warfare","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Prague is already among the largest cities in Europe. King Charles will make it the capital of an empire!\n\nIn Praga Caput Regni, players take the role of wealthy citizens who are organizing various building projects in medieval Prague.

Players choose from six actions on the game board \u0026mdash; the \u0022action crane\u0022 \u0026mdash; that are always available, but which are weighted with a constantly shifting array of costs and benefits. By using these actions, you can increase your resources, improve the strength of your chosen actions, and build \u0022New Prague City\u0022, the Charles Bridge, or city walls. You can possibly gain additional actions or even participate in the construction of St. Vitus Cathedral.\n\nClever players will discover synergies between carefully timed actions and the rewards from constructing civic projects as all of the mechanisms mesh together.

{"bgg_id":328871,"name":"Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition","year":2021,"description":"Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition is an engine-building game in which players control interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable (and profitable). You will do this by investing mega credits (MC) into project cards that will directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process. In order to win, you will want to accumulate a high terraform rating (TR) and as many victory points (VP) as you can. Players raise their TR by increasing global parameters: oceans, oxygen, and temperature. TR also determines each corporation\u0027s basic income, and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP. Additional VP and production capabilities are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.\n\nThe game is played in rounds, and each round the players will choose one of five phases, which determines which activities will take place during that round. This means every round is different, but can consist of building new project cards, taking general and project-specific actions, producing income and resources (plants and heat), or researching to draw more project cards. Every player will take all the phases selected for the round, and will receive a special bonus during the phase that they selected. To speed up the game, within each phase, players can act simultaneously without waiting for each other!\n\nThe game board has tracks for oxygen, temperature, and terraform rating, as well as a place for all of the ocean tiles that will be flipped over the course of the game. The game ends when there is enough oxygen to breath (14%), oceans enough to allow Earth-like weather (9), and the temperature is well above freezing (\u002B8\u0026deg;C). It will then be possible, if not comfortable, to live on the surface of Mars!\n\nThe winner is the player with the most VP at the end of the game.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":45,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":764022,"rank":188,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eT_Atcy_vRJvuUMgYakNrQ__original/img/upZwrb6k8zZMNTwB8VfpI372yuo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6260098.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eT_Atcy_vRJvuUMgYakNrQ__small/img/YxoNRQg9owsoi68POaMY0Ix31ZI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6260098.jpg"],"designer":["Sydney Engelstein:59662","Jacob Fryxelius:52075","Nick Little (I):72770"],"artist":["William Bricker:68048","Sydney Engelstein:59662","Jacob Fryxelius:52075","Garrett Kaida:110790","Jason D.

{"bgg_id":148949,"name":"Istanbul","year":2014,"description":"There\u0027s hustle and bustle at Istanbul\u0027s grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.\n\nIn Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...\n\nIn more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:\n\n\n    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.\n    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.\n    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.\n    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.\n    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.\n\n\nWhen a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who\u0027s reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":40,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":753706,"rank":189,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__original/img/pHIJibqf-DmlOQD3CfT_rAjGmc0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1885326.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__small/img/Vzpg3sdeAbCy0IxSAoh1aH9nvDE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1885326.jpg"],"designer":["R\u00FCdiger Dorn:381"],"artist":["Andreas Resch:11898"],"publisher":["Pegasus Spiele:39","2 Pionki:40920","Albi:4304","Alderac Entertainment Group:396","Asterion Press:15889","Devir:2366","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos:858","Hobby Japan:1391","Hobby World:18852","Lex Games:25203","Matagot:5400","Piatnik:22","Portal Games:2726","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","White Goblin Games:4932"],"category":["Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","Grid Movement:2676","Mancala:2955","Market:2900","Modular Board:2011","Network and Route Building:2081","Pick-up and Deliver:2007","Race:2876","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:02.1194969Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/99865/istanbul-english-rules","title":"Istanbul - English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/122279/istanbul-solo-rules","title":"Istanbul Solo Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/149629/istanbul-reference-card-base-game-plus-mocha-expan","title":"Istanbul Reference Card - Base game \u002B Mocha Expansion","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/136978/istanbul-reference-for-place-actions-mosque-tiles","title":"Istanbul - Reference for Place Actions, Mosque Tiles and Game End","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/197814/istanbul-rules-in-brief","title":"Istanbul - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/208039/istanbul-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Istanbul - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/213785/istanbul-with-mocha-and-baksheesh-complete-rules-s","title":"Istanbul with Mocha and Baksheesh - Complete rules summary EN","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

A game is typically played to 8 or 10 victory points, which may be accrued through winning attacks, controlling temples, controlling fully-developed pyramids, sacrificing to the gods, and wielding particular magical powers.\n\nThe conquest for the land of Kemet takes place over two phases: Day and Night. During the day, choose an action amongst the nine possible choices provided by your player mat and perform it immediately. Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.\n\nAs the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles. Some of these enroll magical creatures and have them join their troops. In addition to intimidating enemies, these creatures provide special powers!\n\nDetailed miniature components represent the combat units and the supernatural creatures that are summoned to enhance them.

{"bgg_id":82222,"name":"Xia: Legends of a Drift System","year":2014,"description":"Xia: Legends of a Drift System is a 3-5 player sandbox style competitive space adventure. Each player starts as a lowly but hopeful captain of a small starship.\n\nPlayers fly their ships about the system, completing a variety of missions, exploring new sectors and battling other ships. Navigating hazardous environments, players choose to mine, salvage, or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches and, most importantly, Fame.\n\nThe most adaptive, risk-taking and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!\n\nCustomize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid, yet fragile, explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship, ready for anything. In Xia, the choice is always yours.\n\nAdapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you\u0027ll do well in Xia!\n\nSandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play - players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play.

Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive. Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power.\n\nThe aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game\u0027s end. Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours. Each turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence among the various areas of society.

{"bgg_id":265188,"name":"Glen More II: Chronicles","year":2019,"description":"Glen More II: Chronicles is a sequel to Glen More, expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game.\n\nIn Glen More II: Chronicles, each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.\n\nThe game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player\u0027s territory to the smallest one in play.\n\nThe core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.\n\nImprovements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.\n\nThe \u0022Chronicles\u0022 in the title \u0026mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game \u0026mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The \u0022Highland Boat Race\u0022 Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players\u0027 territories. The \u0022Hammer of the Scots\u0022 Chronicle adds a neutral \u0022Englishman\u0022 playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn \u0026mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a \u0022monster game\u0022.\n\nAnother major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new \u0022person\u0022 tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":786698,"rank":195,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__original/img/ehoqoTirtFb5p9Wk2SwWV8nr6ZU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5841874.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__small/img/UHuDcnjAwCiXbNfjuY26-EEnG2M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5841874.jpg"],"designer":["Matthias Cramer:34699"],"artist":["Jason Coates:113515","Hendrik Noack:128409"],"publisher":["Funtails:40576","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Delirium Games:40510","Engames:39390","GateOnGames:30155","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lavka Games:34801","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Super Meeple:29409"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Farming:1013","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Commodity Speculation:2013","Grid Movement:2676","Market:2900","Set Collection:2004","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Time Track:2663"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:02.1198341Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/189721/base-game-rulebook-of-glen-more-ii-chronicles","title":"Base Game Rulebook of \u0022Glen More II: Chronicles\u0022","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/195217/glen-more-ii-plus-9-chronicles-quick-rules-guide","title":"Glen More II \u002B 9 Chronicles Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193533/glen-more-ii-solo-variant-rules","title":"Glen More II Solo Variant Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/201598/glen-more-ii-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Glen More II - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/301968/14-sheet-with-all-rules-great-player-aid","title":"1/4 Sheet With All rules - Great Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/189725/chronicle-i-the-dragon-boat-races-rulebook","title":"Chronicle I: \u0022The Dragon Boat Races\u0022 (Rulebook)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/282838/glen-more-ii-chronicles-rules-in-brief","title":"Glen More II Chronicles - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Littered with the modular debris of the precursor civilization, patrolled by malicious extragalactic raiders, and bordered by dense nebulae, The Edge is a last resort for the brave and foolhardy who seek a new life beyond the oppressive reach of the Lords of Unity.\n\nIn this game, you lead a desperate faction seeking to build a new civilization on Andromeda\u0026rsquo;s Edge. You begin with only a space station, a few ships, and a handful of resources. By carefully placing your ships, you will gather resources, claim moons, acquire modules to add to your station, populate planets, and build developments on them. You will battle opponents and compete with others to ascend the progress tracks: Science, Industry, Commerce, Civilization, and Supremacy.\n\nOn your turn, you either launch a starship or return your ships to your station. Launching sends one of your starships to a region of Andromeda, either collecting resources from planetary systems or taking actions at Alliance Bases. If the region is occupied by your opponents or fearsome raiders, face off in a dice battle, with Supremacy on the line but where strategic manipulation can turn a loss into a reward. Returning to your station allows you to activate your engine, using the modules you\u0026rsquo;ve acquired to generate energy, gain resources, and carry out actions.\n\nThroughout the game you will build up your unique faction, building developments (Observatories, Factories, Spaceports, Cities, and Obelisks) and gaining station modules which move you up the progress tracks. Advancement on the tracks is rewarded both during mid-game events and at the conclusion, and is the key to victory.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":80,"max_time":160,"avg_rating":8282,"rank":197,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n3gYugbvd_LHVynDhfoVbw__original/img/wpassO7P8Vb-3tke2X3Ou5Pn0LE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7334483.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n3gYugbvd_LHVynDhfoVbw__small/img/ze7YA6aXpf6xgmDUhD0gv_HoW30=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7334483.jpg"],"designer":["Luke Laurie:63686","Maximus Laurie:150711"],"artist":["Sergio Chaves:98973"],"publisher":["Cardboard Alchemy:46569","Cranio Creations:10768","Frosted Games:29895","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Games7Days:48438","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Lucky Duck Games:33626","Maldito Games:30677","MINDOK:7992","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["Fighting:1046","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040","Hexagon Grid:2026","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:02.1198901Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/279827/andromedas-edge-rulebook-final","title":"Andromeda\u0027s Edge Rulebook Final","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/285380/teaching-script-and-reference-guide","title":"Teaching Script and Reference Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/286041/printer-friendly-icon-guide","title":"Printer Friendly Icon Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/305859/andromedas-edge-commonly-overlooked-rules","title":"Andromeda\u0027s edge - Commonly overlooked rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":103885,"name":"Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game","year":2012,"description":"Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!\n\nWhatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship\u0027s dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you\u0027ll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.\n\nStar Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What\u0027s more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you\u0027ll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...\n\nThe Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What\u0027s more, Star Wars: X-Wing\u0027s quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.\n\nReimplemented by Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":30,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":762667,"rank":200,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yNqgVxaqoZepir7Hzkfe-Q__original/img/H6rYWOhYjT_PXTrvHKyX6FEt-vw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1603292.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yNqgVxaqoZepir7Hzkfe-Q__small/img/idalbLcUm2q9yxVZzRDkLEax5AE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1603292.jpg"],"designer":["Jay Little:4786"],"artist":["Matt Allsopp:34719","Sacha Angel Diener:18345","Jon Bosco:63040","Matt Bradbury:21426","Blake Henriksen:58027","Jason Juta:14590","Lucasfilm Ltd.:13416","Henning Ludvigsen:24858","Jorge Maese:26587","Dallas Mehlhoff:46413","Scott Murphy:39678","David Auden Nash:49382","Vlad Ricean:104761","Matthew Starbuck:41678","Nicholas Stohlman:41679","Angela Sung:49393"],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","cutia.ro:24631","Edge Entertainment:2973","Galakta:4617","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Giochi Uniti:5530","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby World:18852","Korea Boardgames:8291","Martinex:3534","Peliko Oy:17814","Stratelibri:3888","Wargames Club Publishing:8759"],"category":["Aviation / Flight:2650","Bluffing:1023","Collectible Components:1044","Miniatures:1047","Movies / TV / Radio theme:1064","Science Fiction:1016","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Action Queue:2689","Critical Hits and Failures:2854","Dice Rolling:2072","Line of Sight:2975","Movement Template:2963","Player Elimination:2685","Simulation:2070","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:02.1202575Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/91273/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-star-wars-x-wing-mini","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers STAR WARS X-WING MINIATURES GAME Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/89807/rule-reference-cards","title":"Rule Reference Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/84141/rules-summary-maneuver-templates-quality-2-page-by","title":"Rules Summary, Maneuver Templates (Quality, 2 Page) by Daxon ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/105122/x-wing-maneuver-reference-ver-116-wave-7","title":"X-wing Maneuver Reference ver 1.1.6 - wave 7","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/82041/star-wars-x-wing-miniatures-game-rule-summary","title":"Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game Rule Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/90098/x-wing-maneuver-reference","title":"X-wing Maneuver Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/114962/x-wing-ship-guide","title":"X-Wing Ship Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Will you take the road with buildings or a path past farmers? Maybe you\u0027ll have the chance to use your cows \u0026mdash; well, the strength on your cow cards \u0026mdash; to help farmers, getting them on your side and adding grain, a new type of resource, to your income, with grain being used for boat and city tiles.\n\nPerhaps you can unlock shortcuts that allow you to deliver your herd to Buenos Aires more quickly. Sure, you\u0027ll forfeit the use of action buildings, but maybe you can catch others unaware, with the ships leaving before they deliver. The timing of reaching the central train station to deliver your herd has never been so crucial, and valuable bonuses await on the city\u0027s port tiles.\n\nMoney is easier to get in Great Western Trail: Argentina, but you have more to manage in terms of action options, shortcuts, and cards (including the new exhaustion cards), so the challenges won\u0027t let up.\n\nGreat Western Trail: Argentina also includes a solitaire challenge in which Pedro is waiting for you to try to beat his score.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":75,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":822265,"rank":204,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qPNWng17gy-ghltZfNcBwA__original/img/mPJnr0qY9uAap4HKmwBoURzzaZ0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6893215.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qPNWng17gy-ghltZfNcBwA__small/img/gTiEnEHt4zbNFftaB0NSXz42jNA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6893215.png"],"designer":["Alexander Pfister:11767"],"artist":["Chris Quilliams:14057"],"publisher":["eggertspiele:1015","Arclight Games:3475","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Ediciones MasQueOca:24883","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Ghenos Games:4785","Lookout Games:234","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Yayoi The Dreamer:42760","Zvezda:1466"],"category":["Animals:1089"],"mechanic":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Hand Management:2040","Ownership:2911","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Track Movement:2939","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:11.2910416Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/248962/great-western-trail-argentina-english-rule-book","title":"Great Western Trail - Argentina English Rule Book","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/255664/action-andy-great-western-trail-argentina-compact","title":"ACTION ANDY - Great Western Trail Argentina Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/248965/great-western-trail-argentina-solo-rules","title":"Great Western Trail - Argentina Solo Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253686/gwt-argentina-setup-guide","title":"GWT: Argentina - Setup Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

The chapters can be played in any order, but ideally you play them in sequence.\n\nIn each chapter, each player takes a different character role \u0026mdash; Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Farmer Maggot, etc. \u0026mdash; and each character has a condition that must be met in order to pass the chapter and advance in the story. Frodo needs to capture ring cards, for example, while Pippin wants to take as few tricks as possible. As you advance through the chapters, new characters, items, and challenges are introduced to the game.\n\nThe deck consists of 37 cards, with one card being set aside as \u0022lost\u0022 each hand.

The One Ring is the game\u0027s only trump card, but initially rings can\u0027t be led until someone plays one off-suit.\n\nIn the two-player game, one hand of cards is dealt to a dummy player, with some cards being face up and others face down. This dummy is assigned a character, and one of the human players will play cards for it based on which cards are free to be played.\n\nIn the solitaire game, one player plays four hands of face-up cards, with each hand being assigned a character and only a few cards being available at a time. After you play a trick, deal each hand a new card.\n\nIf you own The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game, you can add the following characters to this version of the Road Goes Ever On...:\nBilbo (Peculiar), Gandalf (Grey Wizard), Gildor Inglorion, Fatty Bolger, Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, Barliman, Glorfindel, Bill the Pony, Gl\u0026oacute;in, Arwen, Boromir (Captain of Gondor), Gwaihir, Shadowfax (Lord of Horses), Radagast, Gandalf (Servant of the Secret Fire), Galadriel, and Celeborn.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":20,"max_time":20,"avg_rating":796533,"rank":210,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uC4N_3kQdoHefNPesAHCzQ__original/img/ohKFXmrxtaOPqJyiIMaABIy-WjU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8437787.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uC4N_3kQdoHefNPesAHCzQ__small/img/hLjGKsIwJP43656LEnehjFVRzDE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8437787.png"],"designer":["Bryan Bornmueller:159764"],"artist":["Elaine Ryan:164282","Samuel R.

Lauded by both the public and critics, 7 Wonders has claimed its place as an unmissable reference point in modern board gaming. 7 Wonders is based on a simple and elegant mechanic (drafting) which allows up to 7 players to play with no dead time. Players make their choice and apply all of them at the same time. These choices are varied and their impact is real. Finally, the game is divided into 3 Ages which little by little increase the importance of these choices and thus the tension in the game. The global mechanics and the care given to the artwork are used to immerse the player in Antiquity and have contributed to the game\u0026rsquo;s success.\nA game plays out over 3 rounds, called Ages, during which you simultaneously play cards, one at a time, to develop your City.\n\nThese cards represent the various Buildings you can construct: resource producers, civilian, commercial, military, scientific structures, and guilds.\n\nAt the end of each Age, you go to war with your nearest neighbours. At the end of all 3 Ages, you tally up all of the victory points earned by your City, your wonder, your military prowess, and your treasury.

{"bgg_id":332686,"name":"John Company: Second Edition","year":2022,"description":"In John Company, players assume the roles of ambitious families attempting to use the British East India Company for personal gain. The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.\n\nJohn Company is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company\u0026rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.\n\nUltimately, this game isn\u0026rsquo;t about wealth; it\u0026rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity to establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.\n\nJohn Company engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players. Please make sure everyone in your group consents to this exploration before playing.\n\nThe second edition is extensively revised and is not a reprint.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from designer\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":6,"min_time":90,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":825941,"rank":212,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TAdE4z_bwAAjJlmPrkmKhA__original/img/V5wLvuhU3mKNr6PUf1cxyeemh00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6601629.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TAdE4z_bwAAjJlmPrkmKhA__small/img/pwgtQn8ArKjwBxk3bnDuIVAPWgU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6601629.jpg"],"designer":["Cole Wehrle:35585"],"artist":["Jan Lipi\u0144ski:141525","Amita Pai:149242"],"publisher":["Wehrlegig Games:39814","2Tomatoes Games:30571","CrowD Games:34522","Galakta:4617","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Giochix.it:7251","HIT Games:55324","Spielworxx:15108","YOKA Games:8147"],"category":["Economic:1021","Educational:1094","Negotiation:1026","Political:1001"],"mechanic":["Bribery:2913","Dice Rolling:2072","Negotiation:2915","Push Your Luck:2661","Simulation:2070","Voting:2017"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:11.2911588Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/234224/john-company-rules","title":"John Company Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/248555/joco2e-cheat-sheet","title":"JoCo2e Cheat Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253036/joco-helpy-helper-card-for-player-reference","title":"JoCo Helpy Helper Card for player reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/297274/rules-reference-and-crisis-resolution-player-aids","title":"Rules Reference and Crisis Resolution Player Aids","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/306792/john-company-2nd-edition-rules-summary-v12-by-dirt","title":"John Company 2nd edition - Rules Summary V1.2 (By Dirty Harry)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/308005/john-company-2nd-edition-solo-and-2-player-rules-v","title":"John Company 2nd edition -  SOLO \u0026 2 Player - Rules V1.0 (by Dirty harry)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":188920,"name":"This War of Mine: The Board Game","year":2017,"description":"This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city. You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity. During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices and have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later.\n\nTWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from video game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices. The boardgame significantly broadens the original game\u0026rsquo;s universe and emphasizes the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making.  TWOM: The Board Game is an instant play game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure.\n\nDuring day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements\u0026rsquo; shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep it warm.\n\nUpon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).\n\nYour goal is to survive until the cessation of war hostilities. However, survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":6,"min_time":45,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":776144,"rank":213,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQOQW7p1RWHzY54Lrs-_pA__original/img/PSC8BO2njNcBJhxvi0IV5Jb5hgo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3315915.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQOQW7p1RWHzY54Lrs-_pA__small/img/qmypl6agXd78n1_vAiO5LZcCXHc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3315915.jpg"],"designer":["Micha\u0142 Oracz:5143","Jakub Wi\u015Bniewski:87430"],"artist":["Piotr Gacek:114320","Maszrum:134525","Pawe\u0142 Nizio\u0142ek:93734","Micha\u0142 Oracz:5143","Jakub Wi\u015Bniewski:87430"],"publisher":["Awaken Realms:29412","11 bit studios:16688","Albi:4304","Ares Games:17917","asmodee:157","CrowD Games:34522","Edge Entertainment:2973","Elznir Games:54932","Galakta:4617","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","MYBG Co., Ltd.:23756","Pendragon Game Studio:27654","Summon Games:37459","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Exploration:1020","Mature / Adult:1118","Modern Warfare:1069","Video Game Theme:1101"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Cooperative Game:2023","Dice Rolling:2072","Events:2850","Grid Movement:2676","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Push Your Luck:2661","Role Playing:2028","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Simulation:2070","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Storytelling:2027","Variable Player Powers:2015","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:11.2911688Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150267/pseudo-rulebook-full-copy-of-all-faqs-plus-journal","title":"Pseudo Rulebook - Full Copy of all FAQ\u0027s \u002B Journal Reference \u002B Notes - English","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/149776/advanced-hidden-rules-from-book-of-scripts","title":"Advanced hidden rules from Book of Scripts","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/148844/unwritten-rules-summary-for-new-players","title":"\u0027Unwritten\u0027 Rules Summary for new players","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/151349/what-can-we-build-fittings-reference-tables","title":"What Can We Build?

{"bgg_id":9609,"name":"War of the Ring","year":2004,"description":"In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA).\n\nInitially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.\n\nThe game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\n\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\n\nAction dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n    War of the Ring Collector\u0027s Edition\n    War of the Ring: Second Edition\n\n\nUpgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) \n\n    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit\n\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":778285,"rank":214,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmdqlBJBynZMOciZzkVIkw__original/img/9LYzTUmOTO2enhJvqauMt6odC5Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic725882.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmdqlBJBynZMOciZzkVIkw__small/img/PgSR-5Hd8W6YBrLJLSvOBKH3Sls=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic725882.jpg"],"designer":["Roberto Di Meglio:3247","Marco Maggi:934","Francesco Nepitello:935"],"artist":["John Howe:11884","Matteo Macchi:20674","Fabio Maiorana:20670","Mizio Mencarini:20675","Bob Naismith:12236"],"publisher":["Ares Games:17917","asmodee:157","Devir:2366","Fantasy Flight Games:17","Fantasy Shop:5527","Galakta:4617","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Nexus Editrice:504","Phalanx Games B.V.:855","Red Glove:6123","Sophisticated Games:36","Tilsit:42"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Fantasy:1010","Fighting:1046","Novel-based:1093","Territory Building:1086","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Area Majority / Influence:2080","Area Movement:2046","Campaign / Battle Card Driven:2018","Dice Rolling:2072","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:11.2911883Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/28757/rangerrobs-war-of-the-ring-quick-reference-2nd-and","title":"RangerRob\u0027s War of the Ring Quick Reference (2nd and 1st Editions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/60085/universal-head-war-of-the-ring-rules-summary-and-r","title":"Universal Head WAR OF THE RING Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56178/war-of-the-ring-the-actual-rules-version-41-includ","title":"War of the Ring, the actual rules version 4.1 (including FAQ)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/22336/war-of-the-ring-reference-cards-v10pdf","title":"War of the Ring - Reference Cards v1.0.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/38488/reference-card-for-war-of-the-ring","title":"Reference card for War of the Ring","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68968/war-of-the-ring-rule-card","title":"War Of the Ring Rule Card","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/34404/guide-to-spray-painting-your-figures","title":"Guide to spray painting your figures","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/42231/misplayed-rules-and-things-to-remember","title":"Misplayed rules and things to remember.","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/54208/rules-in-flowchart-form","title":"Rules in Flowchart form","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/37818/war-of-the-ring-rules-summary","title":"War of the Ring rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/7537/how-to-paintpdf","title":"How To Paint.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/53427/a-simple-guide-to-making-a-resin-mtdoom","title":"A simple guide to making a resin Mt.Doom","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80805/war-of-the-ring-rules-summary","title":"War of the Ring - Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/79452/war-of-the-ring-custom-reference-chart","title":"War of the Ring Custom Reference Chart","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/28563/dwarven-rings-wotr-bidding-tournament-rules","title":"Dwarven Rings WoTR Bidding Tournament Rules","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80132/setup-reference-sheet-wotr-2nd-edition","title":"Setup Reference Sheet (WotR 2nd Edition)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/43587/introductory-rules","title":"Introductory Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":314491,"name":"Meadow","year":2021,"description":"Meadow is an engaging set collection game with over two hundred unique cards containing hand-painted watercolor illustrations. In the game, players take the role of explorers competing for the title of the most skilled nature observer. To win, they collect cards with the most valuable species, landscapes, and discoveries. Their journey is led by passion, a curiosity of the world, an inquiring mind, and a desire to discover the mysteries of nature. The competition continues at the bonfire where the players race to fulfill the goals of their adventures.\n\nIn this medium-weight board game for 1-4 players, you take turns placing path tokens on one of the two boards. Placing a token on the main board allows the player to get cards, but playing them requires meeting certain requirements. Playing a token on the bonfire board activates special actions (which helps to implement a chosen strategy) and gives the opportunity to achieve goals that provide additional points. Throughout the game, players collect cards in their meadow and surroundings area. At the end, the player with the most points on cards and on the bonfire board wins.\n\nMeadow also includes envelopes with additional cards to open at specific moments...\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":770785,"rank":216,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9r3qdPijtgoIN24PxFU2gw__original/img/tHQTKwwk4N8J5fpWhsoE8t0FQhw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5894745.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9r3qdPijtgoIN24PxFU2gw__small/img/tugW5aKyC6Vs31QaBX8YvmQiPTQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5894745.jpg"],"designer":["Klemens Kalicki:89488"],"artist":["Karolina Kijak:128605","Katarzyna Fiebiger:133204"],"publisher":["Rebel Studio:47684","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Arclight Games:3475","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Games4you:52408","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby Game Mall:43240","Hobby World:18852","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Animals:1089","Card Game:1002","Environmental:1084","Puzzle:1028"],"mechanic":["Hand Management:2040","Layering:3001","Open Drafting:2041","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:11.291214Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/216803/meadow-rulebook-english","title":"Meadow rulebook (english)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/265131/meadow-setup-guide-w-downstream","title":"Meadow Setup Guide (w/ Downstream)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/256818/meadow-deck-holder-assembly-instructions","title":"Meadow deck holder assembly instructions ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":10630,"name":"Memoir \u002744","year":2004,"description":"Memoir \u002744  is a historical boardgame where players face-off in stylized battles of some of the most famous historic battles of World War II including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra and the Ardennes.\n\nMemoir \u002744 includes over 15 different battle scenarios and features a double-sided hex game board for both beach landings and countryside combat. Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.\n\n\u0022By design, the game is not overly complex\u0022, says Memoir \u002744 designer, Richard Borg. \u0022The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.\u0022 In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir \u002744 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.\n\nMemoir \u002744 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. With Memoir \u002744 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.\n\nThe Memoir \u002744 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.\n\nThis game is based upon Richard Borg\u0027s Command and Colors system.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":75329,"rank":217,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ij9Zpnx1jVmtLtBD3DvLXQ__original/img/S5OMoCGqlYwZQWcnYRUvVmap2NE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic9000036.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ij9Zpnx1jVmtLtBD3DvLXQ__small/img/YvzL5r5jpC7tTYckNgTediSiiXU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic9000036.png"],"designer":["Richard Borg:25"],"artist":["Cyrille Daujean:12519","Julien Delval:11886","Yannick Hennebo:63043","Adrien Martinot:168355","Don Perrin:908","Claude Rica:20387","Caroline S\u00E9bayhi:168143"],"publisher":["Days of Wonder:1027","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Edge Entertainment:2973","Spielworxx:15108"],"category":["Miniatures:1047","Wargame:1019","World War II:1049"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Campaign / Battle Card Driven:2018","Command Cards:2841","Dice Rolling:2072","Die Icon Resolution:2856","Grid Movement:2676","Hand Management:2040","Hexagon Grid:2026","Line of Sight:2975","Modular Board:2011","Movement Points:2947","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Simulation:2070","Team-Based Game:2019","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:11.2912285Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/19199/universal-head-memoir-44-rules-summary-and-referen","title":"Universal Head MEMOIR \u002744 Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/88667/memoir-44-rules-summary-cards","title":"Memoir \u002744 Rules Summary Cards","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/38585/memoir-44-a-beginners-reference","title":"Memoir \u002744 - A Beginner\u0027s Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167576/quick-start-rules","title":"Quick Start Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/305532/rules-english-2025-version","title":"Rules English 2025 version","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":227224,"name":"The Red Cathedral","year":2020,"description":"Autumn is not the best time to climb up on a scaffold in Moscow, but it is still far better than doing so in the winter. Tsar Ivan wants to see results and our team will prove to him that we are the best builders in the city. We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the government\u0026rsquo;s trusted workers.\n\nSheila Santos and Israel Cendrero make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice. To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock \u0026 Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Rom\u0026aacute;n (El mundo de \u0026Aacute;guila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.\n\nThe Red Cathedral is a strategic, \u0026ldquo;Euro\u0026rdquo; board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil\u0027s cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.\n\nDuring the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources. Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.\n\nWhen the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section. The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.\n\nThe players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.\n\nThe game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.\n\nThe Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":80,"max_time":80,"avg_rating":766833,"rank":218,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-PuiCnbxlBzMSjnUegp9AQ__original/img/hH1AwTR4fdtYY_cO8IYp1-I8dhE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5556025.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-PuiCnbxlBzMSjnUegp9AQ__small/img/CKamYUPlBDXav4A1AEqMRy976fY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5556025.jpg"],"designer":["Isra C.:77002","Shei S.:77173"],"artist":["Chema Rom\u00E1n:48302","Pedro Soto:40620"],"publisher":["Devir:2366","999 Games:267","Banana Games:35928","BoardBros:45315","GaGa Games:29194","Hobby Game Mall:43240","IELLO:8923","KOSMOS:37","Portal Games:2726","Reflexshop:36563","Sugorokuya:11611"],"category":["Dice:1017","Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Rondel:2813","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Victory Points as a Resource:2874"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:11.2912494Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/208839/the-red-cathedral-english-rulebook","title":"The Red Cathedral English rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/214844/red-cathedral-quick-rules-guide","title":"Red Cathedral Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/250278/solo-rules-by-fqst","title":"Solo Rules by fqst","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/243824/the-red-cathedral-player-reference","title":"The Red Cathedral - Player Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Scoring is variable per game based on achieving various patterns and varieties of placement...as well as bonus points for dark shades of a particular hidden goal color.\n\nSpecial tools can be used to help you break the rules by spending skill tokens; once a tool is used, it then requires more skill tokens for the other players to use them.\n\nThe highest scoring window artisan wins!\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":74688,"rank":221,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PZt3EAAGV3dFIVuwMR0AEw__original/img/5ug9EeKlH_ucJEUXaFpTZbBJ1GY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3525224.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PZt3EAAGV3dFIVuwMR0AEw__small/img/1m4aryOW1MOpq-8jGkF6gDTJmCY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3525224.jpg"],"designer":["Adrian Adamescu:88370","Daryl Andrews:67502"],"artist":["Peter Wocken:39902"],"publisher":["Floodgate Games:21756","Cranio Creations:10768","CrowD Games:34522","Devir:2366","Engames:39390","FoxGames:26380","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Geekach LLC:58739","Lanlalen:36210","Lex Games:25203","Mandoo Games:30521","Matagot:5400","MEBO Games:38392","MINDOK:7992","MIPL:51614","One Moment Games:30552","Pegasus Spiele:39","Reflexshop:36563","Yes Papa Games:45523"],"category":["Dice:1017","Puzzle:1028"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Grid Coverage:2978","Open Drafting:2041","Pattern Building:2048","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:13.9606717Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/146446/sagrada-rules","title":"Sagrada - Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/159439/rules-summary-on-a-card-for-sagrada","title":"Rules Summary on a card for Sagrada","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167183/sagrada-solo-campaign","title":"Sagrada Solo Campaign","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/207030/sagrada-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Sagrada - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/224001/2-6-player-rules-and-score-card","title":"2-6 player rules and score card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/250211/setupgameplayplacementscoring-aids-for-glory-passi","title":"Setup/Gameplay/Placement/Scoring Aids for Glory, Passion, \u0026 Life","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/190482/sagrada-rules-summary-for-ikea-tolsby-frames","title":"Sagrada Rules Summary for Ikea TOLSBY frames","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/210427/sagrada-rules-summary-bretonicgamer","title":"Sagrada Rules Summary - BretonicGamer","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

During each game, the heroes embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot. Featuring double-sided modular board pieces, countless hero and skill combinations, and an immersive story-driven campaign, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) transports heroes to a vibrant fantasy realm where they must stand together against an ancient evil.\n\nWith danger lurking in every shadow, combat is a necessity. For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character\u0027s abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways. Surges, special symbols that appear on most dice, also let you trigger special effects to make the most of your attacks. And with the horrors awaiting you beneath the surface, you\u0027ll need every advantage you can take...\n\nCompared to the first edition of Descent: Journeys in the Dark, this game features:\n\n\n     Simpler rules for determining line of sight \n     Faster setup of each encounter\n     Defense dice to mitigate the tendency to \u0022math out\u0022 attacks\n     Shorter quests with plenty of natural stopping points\n     Cards that list necessary statistics, conditions, and effects\n     A new mechanism for controlling the overlord powers\n     Enhanced hero selection and creation process\n     Experience system to allow for hero growth and development\n     Out-of-the-box campaign system\n\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":760373,"rank":222,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZN2rpiJ19lg5DZk_iYMMkQ__original/img/E7OjZXGfe2Vfj2qis30aXetbQJQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1180640.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZN2rpiJ19lg5DZk_iYMMkQ__small/img/C6XETjkjDq3zebWc7-Rf_WKh2ak=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1180640.jpg"],"designer":["Daniel Clark (I):11413","Corey Konieczka:6651","Adam Sadler:50880","Kevin Wilson:2336"],"artist":["Alex Aparin:30957","Devon Caddy-Lee:19573","Sylvain Decaux:50680","Tod Gelle:17068","Charl\u00E8ne le Scanff:64812","Thomas Lishman:120249","Henning Ludvigsen:24858","Dallas Mehlhoff:46413","Sandara Tang:36620","Allison Theus:41191"],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Arclight Games:3475","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Edge Entertainment:2973","Galakta:4617","Giochi Uniti:5530","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby World:18852","Wargames Club Publishing:8759"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Exploration:1020","Fantasy:1010","Fighting:1046","Miniatures:1047"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Dice Rolling:2072","Grid Movement:2676","Hand Management:2040","Line of Sight:2975","Map Addition:2959","Modular Board:2011","Movement Points:2947","Multiple Maps:2965","Once-Per-Game Abilities:2846","Role Playing:2028","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Stat Check Resolution:2853","Team-Based Game:2019","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:13.9607548Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81251/universal-head-descent-2nd-edition-rules-summary","title":"Universal Head DESCENT 2ND EDITION Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93172/heroes-quickstart-guide-to-descent-20-comic-style","title":"Heroes Quickstart Guide to Descent 2.0 (comic-style)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/94422/descent-journeys-in-the-dark-second-edition-hero-s","title":"Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition Hero Selection Guide v2.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/104100/descent-class-selection-guides-by-ryno-subscribe","title":"Descent Class Selection Guides by Ryno [Subscribe]","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80262/descent-2e-player-reference-sheet","title":"Descent 2e Player Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/90799/no-overlord-variant-for-descent","title":"No Overlord variant for Descent","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/102406/descent-2nd-ed-monster-reference","title":"Descent 2nd Ed Monster Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135144/guide-to-range-and-los-for-descent-second-edition","title":"Guide to Range and LOS for Descent Second Edition","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/101698/legendary-play-variant-rules-for-first-edition-sty","title":"Legendary Play Variant Rules - For First Edition Style Delving.","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80904/overlord-reference-sheet","title":"Overlord Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/123467/descent-v25-optional-rules-swia-conversion-v107","title":"Descent v2.5 Optional Rules (SW:IA conversion) v10.7","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/89054/descent-1e-quest-conversion-package","title":"Descent 1E Quest Conversion package","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":242302,"name":"Space Base","year":2018,"description":"In Space Base, players assume the roles of Commodores of a small fleet of ships. Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command. Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence. Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence. Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!\n\nSpace Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core \u0022I roll, everyone gets stuff\u0022 mechanism seen in other games. It\u0027s also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach. Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":753936,"rank":223,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHhQxXVjiaa6C-04nGiIWw__original/img/QyWen0FVOKD_4wf7Na7fdsMTjis=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6640638.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHhQxXVjiaa6C-04nGiIWw__small/img/rgETRyeuYs_wiZ5y-9Zj5H8kyFo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6640638.jpg"],"designer":["John D.

{"bgg_id":374173,"name":"Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game","year":2023,"description":"The Rebel Alliance fights valiantly against the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. Each new victory brings the Rebels hope, and each heroic sacrifice strengthens their resolve. Still, the Empire\u0027s resources are vast, and the firepower of its Empire Navy is unmatched. With neither side willing to accept defeat, their war rages across the galaxy...\n\nIn Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game, a head-to-head game for two players, the galaxy-spanning war between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance comes alive on your tabletop. In this easy-to-learn game, you and your opponent each choose a side, playing as either the Empire or the Rebels, and as the game progresses you both strengthen the power of your starting decks and work to destroy each other\u0027s bases. The first player to destroy three of their opponent\u0027s bases wins.\n\nIn more detail, each player starts with a unique ten-card deck, with seven of those cards providing only resources to acquire new cards. Six cards from a galaxy deck are always on display, with Rebel cards facing the Rebel player, Empire cards the Empire player, and neutral cards turned sideways. You can spend resources to acquire cards in the galaxy row that don\u0027t belong to the opponent, and you can use attack power to take out cards that do belong to them, gaining a reward in the process.\n\nEach player starts with a base that lacks abilities (Dantooine for the Rebels and Lothal for the Empire), but when that base is destroyed, you get to choose a replacement from your base deck, with each base having a special ability. Choose wisely to counter your opponent\u0027s plans! In addition to having special abilities, capital ships absorb damage meant for your base.\n\nPlayers also fight for control of a Force track to gain additional resources or make use of \u0022If the Force is with you...\u0022 abilities on their cards.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":30,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":781541,"rank":224,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U6scsOGrPtVym4nCLaYjyw__original/img/bPFq87JbA919A2vxks_PFF2DwsY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7387735.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U6scsOGrPtVym4nCLaYjyw__small/img/0kgu-vLB9MQStlEyaR6bgKkemAQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7387735.png"],"designer":["Caleb Grace:69895"],"artist":["Jake Murray:41638","David Ardila:32122","Borja Pindado Arribas:47502","Cristi Balanescu:59605","Tiziano Baracchi:19822","Colin Boyer:87365","Matt Bradbury:21426","Mark Bulahao:65000","Rovina Cai:72509","J.

{"bgg_id":25021,"name":"Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan","year":2011,"description":"The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.\n\nSekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan\u0027s most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).\n\nThe campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.\n\nTo conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.\n\nSekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:\n\n        No dice are used\n        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.\n        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.\n        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.\n\n\nSekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan\u0027s two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.\n\nSekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.\n\nNo dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don\u0027t fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nLegitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo\u0027s control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.\n\nThe initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.\n\nBlocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.\n\nTrue to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.\n\nEach player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.\n\nTIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns\nMAP SCALE     Point to point\nUNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     2\n\nCOMPONENTS\n    Mounted Map\n    119 wooden pieces\n    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets\n    110 cards\n    Rulebook\n    Two player aid cards\n\nDESIGNER: Matthew Calkins\nMAP, CARD, \u0026 BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey\n\n(source: GMT website)\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":180,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":799085,"rank":225,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eMJAona-uXwh6t2AcugGEg__original/img/4LuFgxwxB8OcjoGBWg6_IxFkZ0s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1063508.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eMJAona-uXwh6t2AcugGEg__small/img/6qn1NgnJ9inZNfLlrBdWK3FritU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1063508.jpg"],"designer":["Matt Calkins:7535"],"artist":["Rodger B.

{"bgg_id":256680,"name":"Return to Dark Tower","year":2022,"description":"For an age, the tower lay in ruins. Unbeknownst to the people of the realm, a great evil stirred in its bowels. It started with strange sightings: a flock of crows flying in circles until they dropped from the sky, the lake frozen solid in the height of summer. In time, they could not deny that which they most feared.\n\nThe evil had not been vanquished. The darkness would soon fall again. The tower will rise.\n\nA \u0022sequel\u0022 to the 1981 grail game, Return to Dark Tower is a game for 1-4 players who take the role of heroes. Together, they gather resources, cleanse buildings, defeat monsters, and undertake quests to build up their strength and discern what foe ultimately awaits them. When the heroes face the tower, the game shifts into its dramatic second act, where the players have one chance to defeat the enemy once and for all.\n\nThe game features both cooperative and competitive modes of play.\n\nThe game features traditional game mechanisms, such as engine building and resource management, paired with a technological interface unlike any seen before in games, including the titular tower, which holds more than a few secrets.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":100,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":820564,"rank":226,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sd0acHeHj9RE-daXPC7pEg__original/img/G6dWPuaWJA9WtymikfcTGj_c4TA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5153383.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sd0acHeHj9RE-daXPC7pEg__small/img/ZDxL0mhIb3Rg8st8zCVZD9ngnf4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5153383.jpg"],"designer":["Tim Burrell-Saward:88714","Isaac Childres:69802","Noah Cohen:75911","Rob Daviau:442","Justin D.

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he\u0027s commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever \u0026mdash; subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he\u0027s building while also selling his services to other players.\n\nIn the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.\n\nAfter each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King\u0027s demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":750262,"rank":228,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jVAMlNeDMVZakxJPy-lDrQ__original/img/J4J6wVMItmWj4Yxt8JmuO1g76PE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7229993.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jVAMlNeDMVZakxJPy-lDrQ__small/img/PfOJx2RMkYg-Uk7mWBMF0HvTxqo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7229993.jpg"],"designer":["Ted Alspach:6046"],"artist":["Ted Alspach:6046","Keith Curtis:17929","Agnieszka Dabrowiecka:42856","Ollin Timm:62217"],"publisher":["B\u00E9zier Games:5774","Arclight Games:3475","Competo / Marektoy:4335","CrowD Games:34522","Gemenot:24867","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lucky Duck Games:33626","Maldito Games:30677","MINDOK:7992","MYBG Co., Ltd.:23756","Planszoweczka.pl:25406","Rawstone:45510","Viravi Edicions:30113"],"category":["Post-Napoleonic:2710","Puzzle:1028"],"mechanic":["End Game Bonuses:2875","Hidden Victory Points:2987","I Cut, You Choose:2906","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Pattern Building:2048","Set Collection:2004","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Progressive:2828"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:13.9609448Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/125880/castles-of-mad-king-ludwig-a-plain-and-simple-guid","title":"Castles of Mad King Ludwig - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/148640/castles-of-mad-king-ludwig-quick-setup-guide","title":"Castles of Mad King Ludwig - Quick Setup Guide","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/177722/rules-summary","title":"Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/267064/castles-of-mad-king-ludwig-second-edition-rules","title":"Castles of Mad King Ludwig: Second Edition rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Sometimes you need a fur, sometimes a tent, but these are all minor quests compared to your long-term goal: Painting a woolly mammoth on the wall so that humans thousands of years later will know that you once existed. (Okay, you just think the mammoth painting looks cool. Preserving a record of your past existence is gravy.)\n\nWhat might keep you from painting that mammoth? Death, in all its many forms.\n\nEach player starts the game with a couple of humans, who each have a skill and a number of life points. On a turn, each player chooses to go to one location \u0026mdash; possibly of the same type as other players, although not the same location \u0026mdash; and while you have some idea of what you might find there, you won\u0027t know for sure until you arrive, at which point you might acquire food or resources, or find what you need to craft a useful object, or discover that you can help someone else in their project, or suffer a snakebite that brings you close to death. Life is full of both wonders and terrors...\n\nAt the day\u0027s end, you need food for all the people in your party as well as various crafts or skills that allow you to complete quests. Failure to do so adds another skull on the tote board, and once you collect enough of those, you decide that living is for fools and give up the ghost, declaring that future humans can just admire someone else, for all you care.\n\nPaleo includes multiple modules that allow for a variety of people, locations, quests, and much more during your time in 10,000 BCE.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":45,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":765343,"rank":229,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/85t1wkwgvh3d2mmjsRcDrw__original/img/ejYTb1MVpf9optjLWlwbYua0TMk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6039256.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/85t1wkwgvh3d2mmjsRcDrw__small/img/K1IMVdd39Or51HpLAfiXz3JNUvI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6039256.jpg"],"designer":["Peter Rustemeyer:92425"],"artist":["Dominik Mayer:103476","Ingram Schell:142361","Franz-Georg St\u00E4mmele:145317"],"publisher":["Hans im Gl\u00FCck:133","999 Games:267","Albi:4304","Arclight Games:3475","Br\u00E4dspel.se:46980","Devir:2366","Feelindigo:36981","Giochi Uniti:5530","Hobby World:18852","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lucky Duck Games:33626","Oxygame:694","Spilbr\u00E6t.dk:44204","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Exploration:1020","Prehistoric:1036"],"mechanic":["Action / Event:2840","Cooperative Game:2023","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Memory:2047","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:13.9609794Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/210355/paleo-rules","title":"Paleo Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/210357/paleo-rules-supplement","title":"Paleo Rules Supplement","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253514/rules-summary-a4","title":"Rules Summary A4","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/269348/paleo-module-instructions-in-card-format","title":"Paleo Module Instructions In Card Format","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/284077/paleo-6pp-rules-cheatsheet","title":"Paleo 6pp rules cheatsheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":188,"name":"Go","year":-2200,"description":"In the game of Go, players alternately place stones on empty intersections of a 19x19 grid. The goal is to enclose territory behind stone perimeters and, secondarily, to tightly surround and capture enemy stones. The game ends when both players pass. The players then add up their territory and deduct the number of captives lost. High score wins.\n\nAs you see, the concept of Go is simple, yet the tactics and strategies are deep enough to enrich a lifetime. Or many lifetimes, for the game has been played for thousands of years. With so long a lineage and a worldwide following, Go has come to be known by different names (Weiqi, Igo, Baduk) and to be played by somewhat differing rules. Those rule differences are small, though, and they seldom affect play.\n\nSo welcome to this masterpiece that is the game of Go, a race for the geographical control of an unclaimed land. Experience running battles and swift reversals, bold invasions and painful sacrifices, each sally, each setback playing out to the dulcet tap of stone on wood.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":30,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":765686,"rank":231,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6qAiZwWxSSKP2kFcA80cZg__original/img/oClfNpLGqRwyqeq54Na_VoVAA3o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1728832.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6qAiZwWxSSKP2kFcA80cZg__small/img/COT5I3D_0dKWrSRHChb-SnQl3Zc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1728832.jpg"],"designer":["(Uncredited):3"],"artist":["Barbro Hennius:33954","Norman Sommer:70252"],"publisher":["(Public Domain):171","(Unknown):3320","3M:92","Alga:404","Ariel Productions Ltd:362","The Avalon Hill Game Co:5","Barnes \u0026 Noble:4922","Borras Plana S.A.:4680","Brybelly:35302","Carl Weible KG:6765","Carlton Books:3828","Cathay:1307","Cayro, The Games:5314","CHH Games:2401","Copp Clark Publishing Company:586","Creative Crafthouse:17388","Crisloid:193","Dal Negro:485","Dilemma Games:11320","Dujardin:3082","Dynamic Games / Dynamic Design Industries:377","E.

{"bgg_id":103343,"name":"A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)","year":2011,"description":"Game description from the publisher:\n\nKing Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.\n\nIn the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!\n\nTo begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.\n\nEach round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.\n\nThe Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!\n\nDuring the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.\n\nIn addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.\n\nTides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What\u0027s more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.\n\nExpanded by:\n\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Dance with Dragons (2012)\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Feast for Crows (2013)\n     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 Mother of Dragons (2018)\n\n\nReimplements:\n\n     A Game of Thrones (2003)\n     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)\n     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)\n\n\n","min_players":3,"max_players":6,"min_time":120,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":752928,"rank":232,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__original/img/3tv6H7jX5T9rqwuI84YZKZDBGcw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1077906.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__small/img/ZQ9guRvmMgYfseBC3_xNscMOKKo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1077906.jpg"],"designer":["Christian T.

{"bgg_id":287954,"name":"Azul: Summer Pavilion","year":2019,"description":"At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal\u0027s greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans \u0026mdash; whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.\n\nIn Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.\n\nAzul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.\n\nAt the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.\n\nAfter all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.\n\nIf you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.\n\nAfter six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you\u0027ve filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":757211,"rank":234,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/843kZ6WR0HfyXWEybA6L7A__original/img/VtYGvhy_YCSw14FpV8FGzv0eMe4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4930887.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/843kZ6WR0HfyXWEybA6L7A__small/img/sOiQSPo_DM7G1Om0PF1T2Z8ACcA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4930887.jpg"],"designer":["Michael Kiesling:42"],"artist":["Chris Quilliams:14057"],"publisher":["Next Move Games:38363","Belleville (\u0411\u0435\u043B\u044C\u0432\u0456\u043B\u044C):50230","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Divercentro:40415","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Ghenos Games:4785","Hobby Japan:1391","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lacerta:5812","MINDOK:7992","MIPL:51614","Pegasus Spiele:39","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","SuperHeated Neurons:48279","Zvezda:1466"],"category":["Abstract Strategy:1009","Puzzle:1028"],"mechanic":["End Game Bonuses:2875","Open Drafting:2041","Pattern Building:2048","Set Collection:2004","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:13.9611764Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/190677/azul-summer-pavilion-en-rules","title":"Azul: Summer Pavilion EN rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/212648/printable-player-board-for-original-azul-rules","title":"Printable player board for Original Azul rules","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/191418/azul-summer-pavilion-quick-rules-guide","title":"Azul Summer Pavilion Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/279105/variant-player-board-for-original-azul-rules","title":"Variant Player Board for Original Azul Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

This version was initially available only in the Nordic Countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland; a worldwide limited-edition release occurred in August 2008 and it has since been kept in print again by Days of Wonder.\n\nThe goal in \u0022Nordic\u0022 remains the same as base Ticket to Ride: collect and play cards to place your trains on the board, attempting to connect the different cities on your ticket cards. The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries. Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played, as well as other cards, in order to be claimed. Locomotives are handled a bit differently as well. On your turn you may take 2 Locomotives if you want, but you can only use them on ferries, tunnels, or the special 9 length route.\n\nUnlike the USA or Europe maps, Nordic is designed for 2-3 players only and has a heavier focus on blocking your opponent and more aggressive play.\n\nAlthough not an official expansion for this set, Ticket to Ride Map Collection 5: United Kingdom \u0026 Pennsylvania can be used as an expansion for Nordic Countries, although limited to the three players included in this set.  Nordic Countries includes three sets of 40 trains, with 5 spare for each colour; the UK map in Ticket to Ride Map Collection 5: United Kingdom \u0026 Pennsylvania requires 35 trains and the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains.\n\nPart of the Ticket to Ride series.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":3,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":762278,"rank":235,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bCdjNIu-O_SzVCfMLZY_KQ__original/img/GhYRV-yJmYEiTaZsZcnEA04YucA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7634498.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bCdjNIu-O_SzVCfMLZY_KQ__small/img/YYhnkc5JxY3qmg-_2w_Tb2rMeXE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7634498.png"],"designer":["Alan R.

Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace\u0027s Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nA revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.\n\nComplete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game\n\nNote: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.\n\nSimilar to:\n\n     Steam\n\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":766294,"rank":236,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sz0wLg3TgycpzSvSMdzRJA__original/img/vi7OckGr7HWbTGOkEyxgcCUIfiU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3869603.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sz0wLg3TgycpzSvSMdzRJA__small/img/lfoHFV0OafSO8boxKEX8V3Tq5TM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3869603.jpg"],"designer":["Glenn Drover:1115","Martin Wallace:6"],"artist":["Kurt Miller:11872","Paul Niemeyer:11997","David Oram:12782"],"publisher":["Eagle-Gryphon Games:597","Winsome Games:65","Edge Entertainment:2973"],"category":["Trains:1034","Transportation:1011","Video Game Theme:1101"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Connections:2883","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hexagon Grid:2026","Income:2902","Loans:2904","Network and Route Building:2081","Open Drafting:2041","Ownership:2911","Pick-up and Deliver:2007","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Auction:2827"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:13.9612374Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56171/essential-and-easy-rule-modifications-for-railroad","title":"Essential and Easy Rule Modifications for Railroad Tycoon (v1.1)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/159665/official-railways-of-the-world-rule-book-compendiu","title":"Official Railways of the World Rule Book Compendium","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132600/rules-for-playing-combined-eastern-and-western-usa","title":"Rules for Playing Combined Eastern \u0026 Western USA Maps ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/85223/rotw-quick-rules-pdf","title":"RotW Quick Rules PDF","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/33836/rrt-australia-rules-pdf","title":"RRT Australia Rules (pdf)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/154663/the-egg-complete-compendium-rulebook","title":"The EGG Complete Compendium Rulebook ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/72162/railways-og-the-world-rules-summary","title":"Railways og the World rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/74809/railroad-tolkoon-rules-version-5","title":"Railroad Tolkoon Rules (version 5)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/118382/rules-summary-eastern-us-and-mexico-maps","title":"Rules Summary (Eastern US \u0026 Mexico maps)","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/158640/railways-of-the-world-rules-summary","title":"Railways of the World rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167809/ink-friendly-railways-of-the-world-rule-book-compe","title":"Ink friendly Railways of the World Rule Book Compendium","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Players win or lose together. Players win when all Monsters are defeated but will lose if the Terror track reaches the skull space OR the Monster deck is empty when a card is needing to be drawn.\n\nOn a player\u0026rsquo;s turn, they will do their Hero phase actions. Then the Monsters act in the Monster phase. Event cards determine which monster is in play.\n\nHorrified includes high-quality sculpted miniatures (Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, Creature from the Black Lagoon). Its innovative, easy-to-learn, cooperative gameplay has players working together against the monsters with varying levels of difficulty.

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.\n\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \u0022Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\u0022 or \u0022Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, thus making it a harder for them to complete it and score points?\u0022 Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.\n\nFirst game in the Carcassonne series.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":30,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":741534,"rank":238,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/peUgu3A20LRmAXAMyDQfpQ__original/img/bP18m_PYjyFOv1IBGgMOteQUneA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8621446.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/peUgu3A20LRmAXAMyDQfpQ__small/img/oEEslN-EGqh82sNI6Aj4_MFXYg0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8621446.jpg"],"designer":["Klaus-J\u00FCrgen Wrede:398"],"artist":["Marcel Gr\u00F6ber:127899","Doris Matth\u00E4us:74","Anne P\u00E4tzke:43873","Chris Quilliams:14057","Franz-Georg St\u00E4mmele:145317"],"publisher":["Hans im Gl\u00FCck:133","64 Ounce Games:24874","999 Games:267","Albi:4304","Astrel Games:7340","Bard Centrum Gier:9074","Brain Games:7162","cutia.ro:24631","Devir:2366","Enigma (Bergsala Enigma):6784","Fantasmagoria:22560","Feelindigo:36981","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Giochi Uniti:5530","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos:858","Hobby World:18852","\u00CDs\u00F6ld ehf.:5020","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lanlalen:36210","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Midgaard Games:3395","MINDOK:7992","M\u00F6bius Games:3504","Monkey Time:23628","NeoTroy Games:32395","Nordic Games ehf:44407","Paper Iyagi:2528","Piatnik:22","Ponva d.o.o.:31904","Rio Grande Games:3","Schmidt Spiele:38","Smart Ltd:8313","Stupor Mundi:9235","SuperHeated Neurons:48279","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Venice Connection:131","Ventura Games:1511","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Medieval:1035","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Enclosure:2043","Kill Steal:2871","Map Addition:2959","Pattern Building:2048","Square Grid:2940","Tile Placement:2002"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:13.9612903Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/87531/carcassonne-standard-complete-annotated-rules","title":"Carcassonne Standard Complete Annotated Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/22896/annotatedrulespdf","title":"AnnotatedRules.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/22900/consolidatedtilereferencepdf","title":"ConsolidatedTileReference.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56183/reference-sheet-and-turn-overview-includes-all-exp","title":"Reference Sheet \u0026 Turn Overview (includes all expansions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167279/carcassonne-quick-reference-sheets-printable-2018","title":"Carcassonne Quick Reference Sheets (Printable) 2018","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/58124/mega-carcassone-player-guide","title":"Mega-carcassone player guide","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":70149,"name":"Ora et Labora","year":2011,"description":"In Ora et Labora (Latin for \u0027Pray and work\u0027), each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings \u0026ndash; little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items \u0026ndash; such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics \u0026ndash; to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.\n\nOra et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg\u0027s fifth \u0022big\u0022 game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.\n\nEach player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.\n\nPlayers also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you\u0027ve placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player\u0027s buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he\u0027ll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.\n\nOra et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":767708,"rank":239,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MLvyN4VJ3QNXBKxli8XLiA__original/img/eDqWAa7vUdsYE6_LXVNzIdClbhw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5089618.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MLvyN4VJ3QNXBKxli8XLiA__small/img/mvTvon7ry-QKtYenVgg0LYUtdRc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5089618.jpg"],"designer":["Uwe Rosenberg:10"],"artist":["Klemens Franz:11507"],"publisher":["Lookout Games:234","999 Games:267","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Game Harbor:12540","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby Japan:1391","HomoLudicus:6275","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lacerta:5812","uplay.it edizioni:17786","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Medieval:1035","Religious:1115","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Modular Board:2011","Network and Route Building:2081","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:13.9614448Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/78991/ora-et-labora-rules-summary","title":"Ora et Labora Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81414/ora-et-labora-card-reference-ireland","title":"Ora et Labora Card Reference - Ireland","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/84693/teaching-guide-for-ora-et-labora-from-the-how-to-p","title":"Teaching Guide for Ora et Labora from \u0022The How to Play Podcast\u0022 ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81356/ora-et-labora-card-reference-france","title":"Ora Et Labora Card Reference - France","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/79186/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/166948/ora-et-labora-rules-summary","title":"Ora et Labora - Rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/275925/ora-and-labora-easy-to-forget-rules","title":"Ora \u0026 Labora: Easy-To-Forget Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.\n\nAll the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game. Roles include: the Captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; the Radio Operator listening to the opposing captain\u0027s orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; the Engineer working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.\n\nCaptain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded \u0026mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.\n\nMultiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":8,"min_time":45,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":750156,"rank":242,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dpu5nFJu4UUJ4Y50WyKueg__original/img/feQTYcCwgIg4LneCYIoaWz12Z24=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7069368.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dpu5nFJu4UUJ4Y50WyKueg__small/img/tRPNrLtteyfINpaFLLqEjyfTA10=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7069368.jpg"],"designer":["Roberto Fraga:285","Yohan Lemonnier:43218"],"artist":["Ervin:88840","Piotr Forkasiewicz:105472","Sabrina Tobal:88839"],"publisher":["Matagot:5400","Arclight Games:3475","asmodee:157","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Bureau de Juegos:26638","Choo Choo Games:49480","Conclave Editora:11043","CrowD Games:34522","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Lex Games:25203","Pegasus Spiele:39","Pendragon Game Studio:27654","Surfin\u0027 Meeple China:36763","WoodCat:47883"],"category":["Deduction:1039","Fighting:1046","Modern Warfare:1069","Nautical:1008","Real-time:1037"],"mechanic":["Deduction:3002","Grid Movement:2676","Hidden Movement:2967","Line Drawing:2039","Real-Time:2831","Role Playing:2028","Secret Unit Deployment:2016","Simulation:2070","Team-Based Game:2019"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:17.1452087Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135753/captain-sonar-rules-summary","title":"Captain Sonar rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/140554/captain-sonar-rules-clarifications-and-errata","title":"Captain Sonar Rules Clarifications and Errata","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/136534/captain-sonar-rules-explanation-aid","title":"Captain Sonar Rules Explanation Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/138791/captain-sonar-quick-rule-reference-gereng","title":"Captain Sonar - Quick Rule Reference (GER/ENG)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/249953/captain-sonar-2nd-edition-rulebook","title":"Captain Sonar - 2nd Edition rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/142286/updated-quick-reference-guides","title":"Updated Quick Reference Guides","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/245517/captain-sonar-role-reference-sheets","title":"Captain Sonar Role Reference Sheets","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/262211/player-aids-updated-to-second-edition-rules","title":"Player Aids - Updated to Second Edition Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/146915/pilot-rule-set-for-capt-sonar","title":"Pilot Rule set for Capt S.O.N.A.R.

After crashing far from your companions, you have complete freedom as to how you explore, discover, and interact with the planet. You view your location from a first-person perspective, and you can communicate with and support other players, but you are separated by vast distances, so only you can see your current location.\n\nIn addition to a mission victory, a destiny victory, or an epic victory (completing both the mission and a destiny), you may define success in Vantage through anything you pursue and achieve.\n\nVantage is not a campaign game. Each game is a standalone experience; you bring to future sessions only what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned about the world.

{"bgg_id":104006,"name":"Village","year":2011,"description":"Life in the village is hard \u0026ndash; but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.\n\nEach player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.\n\nVillage is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.\n\nParaphrased from Opinionated Gamer\u0027s review:\n\nEach player\u0026rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":748469,"rank":244,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__original/img/HZYRVZoUtl7COYnS0NvXNSuaf80=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2760568.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__small/img/5H-bOQSAtO8LaWI3i3_oG3CQHHg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2760568.jpg"],"designer":["Inka Brand:6940","Markus Brand:6941"],"artist":["Dennis Lohausen:12484"],"publisher":["eggertspiele:1015","999 Games:267","Albi:4304","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Fantasmagoria:22560","Fire on Board Jogos:30213","Gigamic:155","hobbity.eu:10562","Hobby Japan:1391","KADABRA:9634","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Ludicus Games:30399","Ludonova:16826","Pegasus Spiele:39","Plan B Games:34188","Stronghold Games:11652","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Tasty Minstrel Games:9499","uplay.it edizioni:17786","Zvezda:1466"],"category":["Economic:1021","Farming:1013","Medieval:1035"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Contracts:2912","Set Collection:2004","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:17.1452464Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71476/english-rules-for-village","title":"English rules for Village","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/77533/village-rule-summarypdf","title":"Village Rule Summary.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81625/rules-summary-quality-1-page-by-daxon","title":"Rules Summary (Quality, 1 Page) by Daxon","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/78693/village-quick-reference","title":"Village Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/117076/village-holistic-summary-includes-inn-and-port-oth","title":"Village holistic summary (includes Inn \u0026 Port; other promos don\u0027t affect the rules)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81574/quick-rules-summary-and-game-management-cheat-shee","title":"Quick Rules Summary and Game Management Cheat Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/90306/mini-set-up-guide","title":"Mini Set Up Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/90308/mini-final-notes-and-scoring-sheet-4-x-6","title":"Mini Final Notes \u0026 Scoring Sheet  4 x 6","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93040/village-rules-summary","title":"Village rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/147206/village-quick-rules-guide","title":"Village Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

As your town grows, you\u0027ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you\u0027ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high-rise office building.

{"bgg_id":14105,"name":"Commands \u0026 Colors: Ancients","year":2006,"description":"From the designer (about his Commands and Colors system, C\u0026C: Ancients, and Memoir\u0027 44):\n\n\u0022Commands \u0026 Colors: Ancients depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Dark Ages (400 AD). Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands \u0026 Colors, by design, is a unique historical wargame system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.\n\n\u0022The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.\n\n\u0022Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill, Commands \u0026 Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.\n\n\u0022The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities.

{"bgg_id":215,"name":"Tichu","year":1991,"description":"Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.\n\nThe game uses either one or two standard 52-card decks with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it\u0027s your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination \u0026mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. \u0026mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.\n\nThe last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player\u0027s unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses \u0026mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call \u0022Tichu\u0022 prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call \u0022Grand Tichu\u0022 after looking at only their first eight cards for a \u0026plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).\n\nThe first team to 1,000 points wins.\n\n","min_players":4,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":75737,"rank":248,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gz8_8iYP2SSGVAxpp7CwLg__original/img/9ULfNvkyu0k1m0d63-Mk0k5e0MA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5854968.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gz8_8iYP2SSGVAxpp7CwLg__small/img/5jkPnPGk5LWNzuW5GANPDLa4ZRA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5854968.png"],"designer":["Urs Hostettler:172"],"artist":["Kerri Aitken:107085","Christine Alcouffe:98418","Res Brandenberger:12118","Fran\u00E7ois Bruel:3025","Philippe Gu\u00E9rin:74074","Urs Hostettler:172","Chris Quilliams:14057","Eduardo M.

{"bgg_id":150376,"name":"Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game","year":2014,"description":"\u0022Crossroads\u0022 is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors\u0027 ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.\n\nDead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that\u0027s fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group\u0027s goal, but don\u0027t get walked all over by a loudmouth who\u0027s looking out only for their own interests!\n\nDead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony\u0027s morale up.\n\nDead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what\u0027s best for the colony and what\u0027s best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":744179,"rank":250,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__original/img/NjrnSg1aeia8I4eETDU3I1Br7a8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3016500.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__small/img/foFGN8KwmN8BaYNpolq0HcMba4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3016500.jpg"],"designer":["Jonathan Gilmour-Long:12679","Isaac Vega:65023"],"artist":["David Richards:77485","Fernanda Su\u00E1rez:70730","Peter Wocken:39902"],"publisher":["Plaid Hat Games:10754","Arclight Games:3475","Cube Factory of Ideas:24042","Edge Entertainment:2973","Fantasy Flight Games:17","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Game Harbor:12540","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Gemenot:24867","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Korea Boardgames:8291","Meanbook Games:48269","MINDOK:7992","Raven Distribution:3242","Rozum:53490","Siam Board Games:33998"],"category":["Bluffing:1023","Deduction:1039","Horror:1024","Science Fiction:1016","Zombies:2481"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Area Movement:2046","Dice Rolling:2072","Hand Management:2040","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Push Your Luck:2661","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game:2822","Semi-Cooperative Game:2820","Storytelling:2027","Trading:2008","Traitor Game:2814","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Variable Player Powers:2015","Voting:2017"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:17.1454047Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/107733/universal-head-dead-of-winter-rules-summary-and-re","title":"Universal Head DEAD OF WINTER Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/106497/dead-of-winter-reference-sheet","title":"Dead of Winter Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/116989/dow-player-reference-sheets-redesigned-and-improve","title":"DoW Player Reference Sheets - REDESIGNED \u0026 IMPROVED","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/200132/dead-of-winter-solo-with-secret-objectives-and-bet","title":"Dead of winter solo - with secret objectives and betrayer","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/118100/dead-of-winter-poor-house-rules-v10","title":"Dead of Winter Poor House Rules v1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135186/variant-rules-helping-survivors-instead-of-helples","title":"Variant (rules): Helping survivors (instead of helpless)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of five markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with.

You control it by holding a large magnet under the board. This magnet is connected to a small magnet placed on the field. The purpose of the game is to push the small, red ball around on the field with your magnet/gaming piece, shoot the ball past the obstacles and your opponent and into the goal hole (Klask). It\u0026rsquo;s so much fun when your opponent suddenly is covered in white obstacles or you drop your gaming piece into the goal \u0026ndash; something which might happen if you get a little too eager!\n\nPlace the game board on a table between the two players. Place the three white magnetic pieces on the white fields on the board. Put two coins in each point slot next to the \u00220\u0022. Each player has a black magnetic gaming piece in two parts. Place the short (thin) part on top of the board and the long (thick) part under the board in such a way, so the two parts \u0026ldquo;catch\u0026rdquo; each other. Place the ball in the corner start field. Steer it with the black gaming pieces.\n\nThe youngest player starts the game.

While there are many paths to victory,\u0026nbsp;players should always seek to optimize their\u0026nbsp;opportunities with every roll of the dice.\u0026nbsp;Combined with ever-changing synergies of the citizens, expeditions, and monasteries, no two games of Coimbra will ever be the same!\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":760008,"rank":259,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JJFHx0RiUBYdy9bHAgVSuA__original/img/zwcZQov_aUfBN0z9J9PzsJqomeI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3956079.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JJFHx0RiUBYdy9bHAgVSuA__small/img/-eaAIbixYxRRVj0tDTS1oP_9Njk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3956079.jpg"],"designer":["Flaminia Brasini:6818","Virginio Gigli:6817"],"artist":["Chris Quilliams:14057"],"publisher":["eggertspiele:1015","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Ghenos Games:4785","Hobby Japan:1391","Pegasus Spiele:39","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","sternenschimmermeer:39249"],"category":["Dice:1017","Renaissance:1070"],"mechanic":["Action Drafting:2838","Auction / Bidding:2012","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Income:2902","Open Drafting:2041","Point to Point Movement:2078","Set Collection:2004","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement with Dice Workers:2935"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:17.1456885Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/167788/coimbra-en-rules","title":"Coimbra - EN Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/166436/coimbra-quick-rules-guide","title":"Coimbra Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/175565/coimbra-quick-reference-one-sheet","title":"Coimbra Quick Reference - One Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/170884/coimbra-game-aid-3-pages","title":"Coimbra game aid - 3 pages","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/174775/coimbra-solo-rules-and-cards","title":"Coimbra solo rules and cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/172831/coimbra-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Coimbra - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/222365/coimbra-iconography-1-page-chart","title":"Coimbra Iconography 1 Page Chart","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/225980/easy-solo-variant-with-little-maintenance","title":"Easy Solo variant with little maintenance","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/196900/coimbra-rules-in-brief","title":"Coimbra - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253814/setup-and-rules-player-aid","title":"Setup and Rules - Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/298918/angel-solos-coimbra-solo-variant-rulebook-translat","title":"Angel_Solo\u0027s Coimbra: Solo Variant Rulebook (Translated to EN)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":91,"name":"Paths of Glory","year":1999,"description":"(from GMT Games\u0027 website:)\n\nThey called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.\n\nPaths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful \u0027place in the sun.\u0027 As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war \u0027to end all wars.\u0027 Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory\u0027s innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.\n\nComponents:\n\n     316 full-color die-cut counters:\n         176 5/8\u0026rdquo; die cut counters\n         140 1/2\u0026rdquo; die cut counters\n    \n     One 22x34\u0022 full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East\n     110 Strategy Cards\n     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)\n     Two Player Reference Cards \n\n\nDESIGNER: Ted Raicer\nDEVELOPER: Andy Lewis\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.\n\nWhile the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":480,"max_time":480,"avg_rating":806911,"rank":260,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ip4TygnwFxuR57Vky9ZeZA__original/img/MP1e5GdDAT-4QO734-n8_rUkMv8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4490515.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ip4TygnwFxuR57Vky9ZeZA__small/img/6yGJ8gs7e_WwYJc5Y7pXgTBFxF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4490515.jpg"],"designer":["Ted Raicer:484"],"artist":["Charles Kibler:2652","Terry Leeds:23441","Rodger B.

Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u0027s too late. The liberal team always has a majority.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn\u0027t know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don\u0027t know who anyone is.\n\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\n\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.\n\n","min_players":5,"max_players":10,"min_time":45,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":748921,"rank":262,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rAQ3hIXoH6xDcj41v9iqCg__original/img/7oKwNUYakx3-vHUBLHWVuFNKfl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5164305.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rAQ3hIXoH6xDcj41v9iqCg__small/img/xA2T7PiwN3Z8pwAksicoCOA1tf0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5164305.jpg"],"designer":["Mike Boxleiter:87375","Tommy Maranges:87376","Max Temkin:20341"],"artist":["Mackenzie Schubert:75735"],"publisher":["Goat Wolf \u0026 Cabbage:34112","(Self-Published):4","Print \u0026 Play Productions:14966"],"category":["Bluffing:1023","Card Game:1002","Deduction:1039","Humor:1079","Party Game:1030","Political:1001","Print \u0026 Play:1120","Spies / Secret Agents:1081"],"mechanic":["Hidden Roles:2891","Player Elimination:2685","Team-Based Game:2019","Traitor Game:2814","Voting:2017"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:20.9759697Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/125456/secret-hitler-rules-pdf","title":"Secret Hitler Rules (PDF)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/154915/reglas-de-secret-hitler-espanol","title":"Reglas de Secret Hitler Espa\u00F1ol","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131578/offical-rules-updated-april-2016","title":"Offical Rules (Updated April 2016)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/148886/secret-hitler-quick-reference-cards-for-beginners","title":"Secret Hitler Quick Reference Cards for beginners (printer-friendly)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/137519/secret-hitler-rules-synthesis","title":"Secret Hitler - Rules synthesis","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/160145/active-policies-affect-gameplay","title":"Active Policies (affect gameplay)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":126042,"name":"Nations","year":2013,"description":"From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!\n\nNations is an intense historical board game for 1\u0026ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.\n\nGameplay introduction\n\nPlayers choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:\n\n\n     Buy a card\n     Deploy a worker\n     Hire an architect for a wonder\n     Special action provided by a card\n\n\nPlayers each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.\n\nWhen all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.\n\nVictory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points is the winner.\n\nSee \u0027More information\u0027 below for link to rules, etc.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":40,"max_time":200,"avg_rating":759224,"rank":266,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-hn7gA50ci0n7j9u_-jHhA__original/img/1RkLWWHzepOqacKarc1176UofVs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1591406.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-hn7gA50ci0n7j9u_-jHhA__small/img/rJqh_lHJ45NZHtxC5uq8xH2_Hzk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1591406.png"],"designer":["Rustan H\u00E5kansson:37300","Nina H\u00E5kansson:60882","Einar Ros\u00E9n:60883","Robert Ros\u00E9n:60884"],"artist":["Ossi Hiekkala:19023","Jere Kasanen:66790","Paul Laane:37840","Frida L\u00F6gdberg:60881"],"publisher":["Lautapelit.fi:3218","asmodee:157","Asterion Press:15889","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Ystari Games:2861"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Civilization:1015","Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","End Game Bonuses:2875","Events:2850","Hidden Victory Points:2987","Income:2902","Open Drafting:2041","Tags:3100","Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:20.9760242Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/95867/nations-english-rules","title":"Nations - English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/98569/nations-guide-4-pages","title":"Nations Guide - 4 pages","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/115939/detailed-player-aid-including-solo-game","title":"Detailed Player Aid (including Solo Game)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/100351/nations-variant-solo-player-rules","title":"Nations - Variant Solo Player Rules ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

(Why you don\u0027t already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)\n\nTo set up play, lay out 25 word cards in a 5\u0026times;5 grid. Place a key card in the holder so that each player sees one side of the card. Each player sees a 5\u0026times;5 grid on the card, with nine of the squares colored green (representing your agents) and three squares colored black (representing assassins). Three of the nine squares on each side are also green on the other side, one assassin is black on both sides, one is green on the other side and the other is an innocent bystander on the other side.\n\nCollectively, you need to reveal all fifteen agents \u0026mdash; without revealing an assassin \u0026mdash; before time runs out in order to win the game. Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct, they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin, you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier.

{"bgg_id":21050,"name":"Combat Commander: Europe","year":2006,"description":"Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more \u0026ldquo;Fate\u0026rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate their units on the mapboard for various military functions.\n\nPlayers attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent\u0026rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario\u0026rsquo;s specific \u0026ldquo;Objective\u0026rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent\u0026rsquo;s board edge.\n\nA game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card \u0022Orders\u0022 conducted by the active player. Fate Card \u0022Actions\u0022 may generally be conducted by either player at any time. \u0022Events\u0022 \u0026mdash; both good and bad \u0026mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player\u0026rsquo;s perfect plan.\n\nSCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.\n\nEach unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad. Radios \u0026mdash; and individual weapons larger than a pistol, rifle or BAR \u0026mdash; are represented by their own counters.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":60,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":79544,"rank":273,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uKaL10FK-u9wfYyK6MQaNg__original/img/_UDsTX8nCwdsynpoVtzHJHc8h6c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic992459.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uKaL10FK-u9wfYyK6MQaNg__small/img/4KyQXL7NMnaXSVYimKkJRCjQ2I8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic992459.jpg"],"designer":["Chad Jensen:6331"],"artist":["Lee Brimmicombe-Wood:2370","Chad Jensen:6331","Rodger B.

{"bgg_id":129437,"name":"Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game","year":2012,"description":"Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain\u0027s attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain\u0027s particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks \u0026ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. \u0026ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what\u0027s available.\n\nOver the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player\u0027s turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains \u0022master strike\u0022 cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.\n\nAs players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game\u0027s end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however \u0026ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes \u0026ndash; then the players all lose.\n\nHero decks in the base game: Gambit, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Emma Frost, Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Storm, Captain America, Nick Fury, Rogue, Cyclops, Hulk, Wolverine, Deadpool\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":751985,"rank":278,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZrRidumkzu62HuwKdgQpHA__original/img/FqPcmpzntFV1FDR6dniHGKvNwvI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1430769.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZrRidumkzu62HuwKdgQpHA__small/img/Q9zldSDfcsSXiD6SC4MU-dwCl5g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1430769.jpg"],"designer":["Devin Low:5816"],"artist":["Julius Abrea:65636","Will Conrad:65637","Bien Flores:62181","Katrina Mae Hao:65638","Ray Anthony Height:65639","Tony Kordos:65640","The Marvel Bullpen:15382","Jay David Ramos:65641","Nigel Raynor:65642","Kevin Sharpe:14993","Brian \u201CTots\u201D Valerz:65643"],"publisher":["Upper Deck Entertainment:517"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Comic Book / Strip:1116"],"mechanic":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Events:2850","Open Drafting:2041","Semi-Cooperative Game:2820","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:20.9762088Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/83353/marvel-legendary-rule-book","title":"Marvel Legendary Rule book","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/168153/universal-rulebook","title":"Universal Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/121076/combined-legendary-rules","title":"Combined Legendary Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/92659/agent-coulsons-recruit-assessments-a-new-players-g","title":"Agent Coulson\u0027s Recruit Assessments-(A New Players Guide to the Heroes and a Reminder to the Rest of Us)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/235174/marvel-legendary-complete-keywords-reference-curre","title":"Marvel Legendary Complete Keywords / Reference (current through 2099)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131576/the-golden-solo-ruleset-printable-rulesheet","title":"The Golden Solo Ruleset - Printable Rulesheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/107518/marvel-legendary-icon-and-keyword-reference-by-ryn","title":"Marvel Legendary Icon and Keyword Reference by Ryno [Subscribe]","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/171021/minimalist-keyword-reference","title":"Minimalist Keyword Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":156129,"name":"Deception: Murder in Hong Kong","year":2014,"description":"Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.\n\nIn the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case \u0026ndash; but there\u0027s a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player\u0027s role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer\u0027s team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!\n\nThe Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!\n\nFind out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!\n\nRoles\n\nForensic Scientist x1\nAs the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the \u0026ldquo;Key Evidence\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Means of Murder.\u0026rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.\n\nDuring the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.\n\nMurderer x1\nWhen the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the \u0026ldquo;Key Evidence\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Means of Murder\u0026rdquo; respectively.\n\nThe Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the \u0026ldquo;Key Evidence\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Means of Murder\u0026rdquo;.\n\nInvestigators x8\nTo solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the \u0026ldquo;Key Evidence\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Means of Murder,\u0026rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).\n\nBear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.\n\nAccomplice x1\nThe Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players.

Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you\u0027ve mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.\n\nBattle of Legends, Volume One features four heroes. King Arthur sacrifices cards to power up his attacks and gets some timely assistance from Merlin\u0027s magic. Alice is back from Wonderland with a giant vorpal blade and the Jabberwock by her side as she grows and shrinks to gain advantages on attack and defense. Medusa is happy to attack from range and let her harpies hound you, but just one devastating glance could end the battle quickly. Sinbad grows in power as he gains experience on each of his voyages.\n\nCombat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card\u0027s unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh\u0026auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.\n\nThe game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that\u0027s brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":20,"max_time":40,"avg_rating":768476,"rank":288,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4AlLbprNustr9G7pbkGRuw__original/img/d7Z89SEv9T_HqPaYEomeKcFmgeA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4621579.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4AlLbprNustr9G7pbkGRuw__small/img/nVkIL7RgCkFpBuxbJ3BfOxIJscU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4621579.jpg"],"designer":["Rob Daviau:442","Justin D.

{"bgg_id":19857,"name":"Glory to Rome","year":2005,"description":"In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.\n\nGlory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don\u0027t follow may \u0027think\u0027 to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.\n\nThe lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the \u0027black box\u0027 edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.  Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":749479,"rank":290,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S_-n-WRvpzgH-d8xuzJgmg__original/img/cvWVDcSUBsngibbELMhABgIyrVo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1079512.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S_-n-WRvpzgH-d8xuzJgmg__small/img/2KvAr_TOIvW-9DNxlX-KuyL0Fwo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1079512.png"],"designer":["Ed Carter (III):1164","Carl Chudyk:6001"],"artist":["Ed Carter (III):1164","Valerio Cioni:50720","Klemens Franz:11507","Felix Girke:41076","Heiko G\u00FCnther:50716","Igor Wolski:49487"],"publisher":["Cambridge Games Factory:4569","(Web published):1001","Boat City:17080","Compaya.hu: Gamer Caf\u00E9 Kft.:14813","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","HomoLudicus:6275","Lookout Games:234","uplay.it edizioni:17786"],"category":["Ancient:1050","Card Game:1002","City Building:1029","Economic:1021"],"mechanic":["End Game Bonuses:2875","Follow:2843","Hand Management:2040","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Set Collection:2004","Sudden Death Ending:2884","Variable Phase Order:2079"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:23.7137202Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/78587/blackbox-edition-rulebook-pdf","title":"Blackbox Edition Rulebook PDF","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/65128/complete-rules-and-building-reference-1-page-front","title":"Complete Rules and Building Reference 1 Page (front/back)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66398/glory-to-rome-quick-rules","title":"GLORY TO ROME Quick Rules","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/258186/neros-folly-glory-to-rome-solo-rules-v1","title":"Nero\u0027s Folly - Glory to Rome Solo Rules v1","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/85304/quick-rules-summary-and-game-management-cheat-shee","title":"Quick Rules Summary and Game Management Cheat Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71512/rules-for-decline-and-fall-gtr-fan-expansion","title":"Rules for Decline and Fall -- GtR Fan Expansion","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/172697/glory-to-rome-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Glory to Rome - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/136049/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

You will also use the services of notable people who will be welcomed into your houses. You will thus gain prestige that will make you the most famous merchant of the Renaissance.\n\nTiletum is a dice management game in which dice have a dual function: gaining resources and performing actions. A certain number of dice will be rolled each round. On your turn, choose a die to gain the number of corresponding resources equal to the value of the die, then perform the associated action. The power of the action is inversely proportional to the value of the die, so the fewer resources you gain, the more powerful the actions you take and vice versa.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":100,"avg_rating":786169,"rank":291,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DvvSoTrB3-UMEgz2rBraHg__original/img/a70U9DGHGxiyo8WWMOb9Zd4hrxc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7533289.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DvvSoTrB3-UMEgz2rBraHg__small/img/TnJONz9KNXPJBQ42sorXuoUTlew=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7533289.jpg"],"designer":["Simone Luciani:35418","Daniele Tascini:59986"],"artist":["Giorgio De Michele:50670","Zbigniew Umgelter:86237"],"publisher":["Board\u0026Dice:26630","Board Bound:58538","CMON Global Limited:21608","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Giant Roc:42147","Giochix.it:7251","Maldito Games:30677","Midnight Jungle:48587","Mosaico Jogos:44349","Pixie Games:30034","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","\u30C6\u30F3\u30C7\u30A4\u30BA\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30BA (TendaysGames):22609","TLAMA games:41423","Well Designed Game:53618"],"category":["Renaissance:1070"],"mechanic":["Action Drafting:2838","Action Points:2001","Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","End Game Bonuses:2875","Point to Point Movement:2078","Set Collection:2004","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:23.7137324Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/245072/official-rules","title":"Official rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/260769/official-faq","title":"Official FAQ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/252017/tiletum-setup-guide","title":"Tiletum Setup Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/303517/action-andy-tiletum-complete-compact-rules","title":"ACTION ANDY - TILETUM Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253689/solo-rules","title":"Solo rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":367150,"name":"Dune: War for Arrakis","year":2024,"description":"Arrakis is a desert world seemingly dead and barren, yet here lies the most important resource in the galaxy: Spice. Without Spice, space travel is impossible, and humans become little clusters on isolated planets. The noble House that controls Arrakis and the production of Spice wields great power. The Emperor gave Arrakis to House Atreides, but then he conspired to replace them with their old rivals, House Harkonnen. Baron Harkonnen crushed the Atreides in a treasonous attack, and now rules the planet with an iron fist. But Paul and Jessica, heirs to House Atreides, are alive, and are mounting a rebellion with the aid of the formidable Fremen, the mysterious inhabitants of the barren expanses of Arrakis.\n\nOnly one House will emerge victorious from the coming struggle, while the other will be lost in the desert sands. It\u0027s into this grim reality that players will be thrust in Dune: War for Arrakis.\n\nIn this asymmetrical strategy game, players fight for control of the planet, maneuvering troops like the Fremen, the Fedaykin, and the fearsome Sardaukar, while sending Spice harvesters into the deep desert, daring to challenge the great Sandworms. The game features an action dice system with numerous event cards that will enable players to retell the Dune saga differently with each playthrough.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":848194,"rank":298,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b_Uo-x3szhupSWeQdw5bdg__original/img/FGqkNWPyWBiERARxf5eLuLt831o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7088918.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b_Uo-x3szhupSWeQdw5bdg__small/img/890K-CXqdcJoNgICyOlpnru48v4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7088918.jpg"],"designer":["Marco Maggi:934","Francesco Nepitello:935"],"artist":["Henning Ludvigsen:24858","Stefano Moroni:34328","Paolo Parente:10548","Steve Prescott:14348"],"publisher":["CMON Global Limited:21608","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Gale Force Nine, LLC:11420","Geekach LLC:58739","Hobby World:18852","Portal Games:2726"],"category":["Dice:1017","Movies / TV / Radio theme:1064","Novel-based:1093","Science Fiction:1016","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Action Drafting:2838","Area Majority / Influence:2080","Area Movement:2046","Campaign / Battle Card Driven:2018","Dice Rolling:2072","Die Icon Resolution:2856","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040","Simulation:2070","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Team-Based Game:2019","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:23.7139434Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/272592/dune-wfa-rules-summary-core-tsg-smg","title":"Dune WfA - Rules Summary Core-TSG-SMG","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/289942/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-dune-war-for-arrakis","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers DUNE: WAR FOR ARRAKIS Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/290777/war-for-arrakis-variant-rules-for-more-realistic-g","title":"War for Arrakis - Variant Rules for more realistic guerrilla war","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/287235/paste-ups-to-bring-your-original-manual-up-to-faq","title":"Paste-Ups to bring your original manual up to FAQ 3.0 level","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/278608/figure-reference-sheet","title":"Figure Reference sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/272561/atreides-turn-reference","title":"Atreides Turn Reference","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/314412/player-aidrules-summary","title":"Player Aid/Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/276661/one-page-small-house-rules-variant-for-dune","title":"one page small house rules variant for Dune","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":150145,"name":"Skull King","year":2013,"description":"Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard, Euchre and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they\u0027ll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.\n\nSkull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, two Mermaids, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they\u0027ll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).\n\nStandard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards \u0026mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything \u0026mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.\n\nIf a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number \u0026mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":8,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":753167,"rank":299,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1qvA21HdRaPYwrn4tGDNaQ__original/img/Vn6PK_Ue5TX14oQ5uau4XICHEJU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8689185.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1qvA21HdRaPYwrn4tGDNaQ__small/img/3tBwuRBxhDuhcTvA1g-IjVuUXqY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8689185.jpg"],"designer":["Brent Beck:58896","Jeffrey Beck:118284"],"artist":["David Bock:116989","Eckhard Freytag:12011","Apryl Stott:71079"],"publisher":["Grandpa Beck\u0027s Games:26030","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Devir:2366","Ghenos Games:4785","OPEN\u0027N PLAY:37303","Playte:50209","Popcorn Games:41167","Ravensburger:34","\u30EA\u30B4\u30EC (rigoler):43169","Schmidt Spiele:38"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Nautical:1008","Pirates:1090"],"mechanic":["Hand Management:2040","Predictive Bid:3006","Rock-Paper-Scissors:2003","Trick-taking:2009"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:23.7139645Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150029/skull-king-player-reference-schmidt","title":"Skull King Player Reference (Schmidt)","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/215337/skull-king-rules-sheet","title":"Skull King Rules Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/215338/skull-king-expansion-rules","title":"Skull King Expansion Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/309457/consolidated-rules-wboth-expansions","title":"Consolidated Rules w/Both Expansions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Each player also has three y\u014Dkai guardians (in the form of dice) that they can send to the large regions of the forest on the main board in order to obtain all kinds of new options that they can play during the game. These options can be structures they build in certain areas of the forest, soul crystals that generate resources when certain actions are carried out, and many others as well. The players also have the chance to help the mitamas, lost souls in search of redemption by using the chinkon fireflies.\n\nThere is truly a wide range of actions to carry out, and this is without taking into account the personal domain where the players can lay out another layer of additional strategy while managing the pilgrims.

The game includes basic rules for two-player games, along with rules for multiplayer formats such as Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra.\n\nEach player starts the game with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row.

{"bgg_id":9216,"name":"Goa","year":2004,"description":"Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.\n\nEach turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.\n\nAfter the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it\u0027s not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.\n\nThe game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.\n\nThe 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":755313,"rank":305,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qVr5oSdmchY0XauUmh5DrQ__original/img/gXfJ5AXK_wtArQYS4CJzzKcHu80=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic9209550.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qVr5oSdmchY0XauUmh5DrQ__small/img/CX75cO_XT7AJG5AheWvAvop_IGY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic9209550.jpg"],"designer":["R\u00FCdiger Dorn:381"],"artist":["Xavier Gueniffey Durin:36093","Oliver Freudenreich:11901"],"publisher":["Hans im Gl\u00FCck:133","Quined Games:10663","999 Games:267","Asterion Press:15889","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","HomoLudicus:6275","Lacerta:5812","Lookout Games:234","Rio Grande Games:3","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Economic:1021","Farming:1013","Nautical:1008","Renaissance:1070"],"mechanic":["Auction / Bidding:2012","Auction: Once Around:2923","Hand Management:2040","Push Your Luck:2661","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:33.4466276Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/73061/official-rio-grande-rules-colour","title":"Official Rio Grande rules (colour)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/25746/goa-quick-referencepdf","title":"Goa - Quick Reference.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/85322/goa-a-new-expedition-rules-summary","title":"Goa: A New Expedition Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/5258/updated-english-rulesdoc","title":"Updated English rules.doc","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/83050/teaching-guide-for-goa-from-the-how-to-play-podcas","title":"Teaching Guide for Goa from \u0022The How to Play Podcast\u0022","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":421,"name":"1830: Railways \u0026 Robber Barons","year":1986,"description":"1830 is one of the most famous 18xx games. One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no \u0027chance\u0027 element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.\n\nThis game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham\u0027s 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, \u0027robber baron\u0027 oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.\n\nThe 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham\u0027s original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world\u0027s best railroad game developers.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":7,"min_time":180,"max_time":360,"avg_rating":786695,"rank":309,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3EmD1SEI5fVpR4rbdkU0AA__original/img/M6qiL7ZNU_mjgZXHZjOrVxNamfU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic882119.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3EmD1SEI5fVpR4rbdkU0AA__small/img/v_GuoUgKbMTvzcRkTcH6aOH9wWs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic882119.jpg"],"designer":["Bruce Shelley:1329","Francis Tresham:58"],"artist":["Mike Atkinson:12516","Jared Blando:12193","Charles Kibler:2652","James Talbot:13649","Mark Zug:13456"],"publisher":["The Avalon Hill Game Co:5","Lookout Games:234","999 Games:267","Game Harbor:12540","Mayfair Games:10","Stratelibri:3888"],"category":["Economic:1021","Trains:1034","Transportation:1011"],"mechanic":["Auction / Bidding:2012","Hexagon Grid:2026","Investment:2910","Market:2900","Network and Route Building:2081","Ownership:2911","Stock Holding:2005","Tile Placement:2002","Victory Points as a Resource:2874"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:33.4466813Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/17371/rules1830rtf","title":"rules1830.rtf","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/33821/quick-rules-cheatsheet","title":"quick rules cheatsheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131517/cleaner-copy-of-the-original-avalon-hill-rules","title":"Cleaner copy of the original Avalon Hill rules.","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/59115/teaching-guide-for-1830-from-the-how-to-play-podca","title":"Teaching Guide for 1830 from The How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/139825/1830-avalon-hill-rules-and-1990s-strategy-guides","title":"1830 Avalon Hill Rules \u0026 1990s Strategy Guides","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81938/fix-tiles-visual-guide","title":"Fix tiles Visual Guide","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/8241/rulesof1830pdf","title":"RulesOf1830.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/182141/1830-rules-difference-list-2018-lookout-games-vers","title":"1830 Rules Difference List (2018 Lookout Games version)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/198487/mayfair-1830-starter-rules","title":"Mayfair 1830 Starter Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":109276,"name":"Kanban: Driver\u0027s Edition","year":2014,"description":"\u0022Kanban\u0022 \u0026mdash; or \u770B\u677F, the Japanese word for billboard \u0026mdash; is a term for the visual cues that might be used in a lean, efficient assembly line in order to expedite and smooth workflow. These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.\n\nThe setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate \u0026mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable \u0026mdash; failure \u0026mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.\n\nOver the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn\u0027t wait for you or for mistakes.\n\nLike the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding.

{"bgg_id":31481,"name":"Galaxy Trucker","year":2007,"description":"In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.\n Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?\n\nOf course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It\u0027s loads of fun.\n\nGalaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.\n\nBuilding happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won\u0027t know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don\u0027t want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.\n\nOnce building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, combat zones, and other various things.\n\nMost of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!\n\n3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":732532,"rank":312,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gLFt1Kif5Cfag505_COYYw__original/img/5vUNCkVDoQpcTfmlhFzkS4e1EaQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3926631.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gLFt1Kif5Cfag505_COYYw__small/img/WOW_QsRuV1KyP8dLjP0yH6TlpvU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3926631.jpg"],"designer":["Vlaada Chv\u00E1til:789"],"artist":["Tom\u00E1\u0161 Ku\u010Derovsk\u00FD:28450","Radim Pech:11938"],"publisher":["Czech Games Edition:7345","Albi:4304","asmodee:157","Devir:2366","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","HomoLudicus:6275","IELLO:8923","Lex Games:25203","Magellan:23031","One Moment Games:30552","Playgo Hungary:8795","Quined White Goblin Games:4696","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Red Glove:6123","REXhry:21053","Rio Grande Games:3"],"category":["Real-time:1037","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113","Transportation:1011"],"mechanic":["Dice Rolling:2072","Events:2850","Grid Coverage:2978","Open Drafting:2041","Pattern Building:2048","Push Your Luck:2661","Real-Time:2831","Relative Movement:2954","Square Grid:2940","Team-Based Game:2019","Tile Placement:2002","Track Movement:2939","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:33.4467124Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/31983/galaxy-trucker-quick-reference","title":"Galaxy Trucker Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/63694/reference-1-page-frontback-includes-expansions","title":"Reference 1 page front/back includes expansions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/38558/galaxy-trucker-rules-summary","title":"Galaxy Trucker rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/39137/special-upgrades-rules-and-tiles","title":"Special Upgrades - rules and tiles","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/30418/quick-reference-for-ship-building-components-v20","title":"Quick Reference for Ship Building Components v2.0","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/40089/tile-reference-sheet","title":"Tile reference sheet.

Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.\n\nUsing those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards).

However, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Mind MGMT is now rotting from the inside. To tighten its iron grip on the world stage, Mind MGMT deploys covert operatives around the world to recruit other psychically-attuned individuals to their side. How can this enigmatic organization, hell bent on global domination, be defeated?\n\nThankfully, a few renegade agents have figured out that Mind MGMT has been compromised and have defected, turning their backs on the syndicate. They now use their own psychic abilities to prevent Mind MGMT from achieving its nefarious goals.\n\nIn Mind MGMT: The Psychic Espionage \u0022Game\u0022 one player controls Mind MGMT and must scour the city for new recruits. They move around on a secret map, trying to visit locations that match one of their three randomly drawn feature cards. They can also use their four Immortals to protect locations from being exposed.\n\nAll other players control the rogue agents who must try to stop Mind MGMT before it\u0027s too late! They ask questions to the Recruiter and deduce their whereabouts from the answers they receive. Rogue agents can use dry-erase \u0022mental notes\u0022 to track all the information they\u0027re given.\n\nMind MGMT wins by either collecting twelve recruits or surviving sixteen turns.

You must prove your worth and gain her trust by enlisting allies, friends, and family of the Princess to carry a letter of intent to her. Can you earn the Princess\u0027 trust and become her confidant?\n\nPlaying cards one at a time, players in Love Letter use the abilities of these key people in the Princess\u0027 life to outwit their opponents and successfully deliver their letter and gain her favor. Players must utilize each character\u0027s special skill to avoid being caught and successfully deliver their letter to the Princess. Once a set number of favor tokens are acquired, that player wins and becomes the Princess\u0027 confidant.\n\nThis 2019 edition of Love Letter features new artwork by Citadels artist Andrew Bosley, screen-printed tokens, and two new characters (five cards in total) that allow for games with up to six players. When played, the Chancellor (value 6) allows you to draw two new cards, add those to your hand, then place two cards of your choice on the bottom of the deck.

{"bgg_id":27708,"name":"1960: The Making of the President","year":2007,"description":"From the author:\n\n\u0022Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.\n\n\u0022In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters\u0027 pocket books in mind.\n\n\u0022The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960\u0026mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon\u0026rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower\u0026rsquo;s late endorsement, and the \u0027Catholic question\u0027 are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state\u0026rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.\n\n\u0022As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.\u0022\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":90,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":761748,"rank":320,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p-k_CqUvJzTcMMz4ms7f_Q__original/img/jCMiFqLiGxgXM7akNX3KLHEI6-o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3499166.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p-k_CqUvJzTcMMz4ms7f_Q__small/img/LZFIiC173jPXvtxUGeNh9eGedpc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499166.jpg"],"designer":["Christian Leonhard:8251","Jason Matthews:3877"],"artist":["Josh Cappel:9731","Donal Hegarty:24469","Christian Leonhard:8251","Rodger B.

Journey across islands, building huts where the resilient men and women of your tribes can settle, discovering fishing grounds and collecting shells. Send priests to the temples, and gather offerings to curry favor with the gods.\n\nIn Bora Bora, players use dice to perform a variety of actions using careful insight and tactical planning. The heart of the game is its action resolution system in which 5-7 actions are available each round, the exact number depending on the number of players. Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action. Place a high number on an action, and you\u0027ll generally get a better version of that action: more places to build, more choices of people to take, better positioning on the temple track, and so on. Place a low number and you\u0027ll get a worse action \u0026ndash; but you\u0027ll possibly block other players from taking the action at all as in order to take an action you must place a die on it with a lower number than any die already on the action.\n\nThree task tiles on a player\u0027s individual game board provide some direction as to what he might want to do, while god tiles allow for special actions and rule-breaking, as gods are wont to do.

U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers \u0026ndash; Meriwether Lewis and William Clark \u0026ndash; to discover this huge terra incognita.\n\nLewis \u0026 Clark is a board game in which each player manages an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.\n\nLewis \u0026 Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new \u0022handbuilding\u0022 mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.\n\nSince the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players\u0027 positions are crucial.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":743529,"rank":322,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IiJ1JK6AjlSCKsC8U_DqMw__original/img/4W8ffc5xOvC6sl660XMGCBqkzJ8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5375937.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IiJ1JK6AjlSCKsC8U_DqMw__small/img/sRsfWxhyB9hPjkFVSE1y_W_AiP8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375937.jpg"],"designer":["C\u00E9drick Chaboussit:67874"],"artist":["Vincent Dutrait:12130"],"publisher":["Ludonaute:11688","asmodee:157","Asterion Press:15889","EVA GAMES:45494","GateOnGames:30155","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby World:18852","Hunter \u0026 Cron:39594","Maldito Games:30677","MeepleBR:32591","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","REXhry:21053"],"category":["Age of Reason:2726","American West:1055","Exploration:1020"],"mechanic":["Action Retrieval:2839","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Delayed Purchase:2901","Hand Management:2040","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Open Drafting:2041","Race:2876","Resource to Move:2948","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Track Movement:2939","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:36.9041866Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/99334/second-edition-rulebook","title":"Second edition rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/103897/ivangrimms-reference-card-alternate-format","title":"IvanGrimm\u0027s Reference Card - alternate format","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/102298/reference-card","title":"Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/97945/lewis-and-clark-card-reference","title":"Lewis \u0026 Clark Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/161867/lewis-and-clark-quick-rules-guide","title":"Lewis and Clark Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/162265/a5-quick-reference-card-for-complicated-character","title":"A5 quick reference card for complicated character cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/134131/lewis-and-clark-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Lewis and Clark - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/115993/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.\n\nSome have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.

{"bgg_id":329500,"name":"Unconscious Mind","year":2024,"description":"In the early 1900s, the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud established a revolutionary theory called psychoanalysis, related to the study of the unconscious mind. As his work took hold, supporters met at Freud\u0027s apartment every Wednesday to discuss psychology and dream symbolism. This group\u0026mdash;the Wednesday Psychological Society\u0026mdash;marked the beginning of the worldwide psychoanalytic movement. As a member of this society, you aim to formulate new therapeutic techniques, establish a practice, grow your clientele, and become Freud\u0026rsquo;s most distinguished contemporary. To best accomplish this, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to share insights, discuss ideas with peers, and publish theories. And to stay invigorated, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely need some coffee\u0026mdash;lots of coffee.\n\nUnconscious Mind is a euro-style game featuring worker placement, engine building, multiple rondels, and cascading effects. On your turn, you may place one or two Ideas (workers) on a central Meeting Table to access a variety of actions, such as adding tiles to your player board, drafting and playing cards, and moving around the city of Vienna. Where you place your Ideas also determines how far to advance your rondel\u0026rsquo;s inkpot, activating a row or column of tile effects on your player board.\n\nTo treat your clients and interpret their dreams, you must work with a supply of Insight resources, which you\u0026rsquo;ll manage on a multi-level dial. As you work through surface-level Manifest dreams into deep-seated Latent dreams, these Insights will help your clients reach catharsis. This is represented by lifting transparent layers from the client cards\u0026mdash;unlocking their ongoing special abilities and end-game scoring opportunities.\n\nOnce the group has solidified its reputation, the end of the game is signaled, and the member with the most points wins.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":790799,"rank":325,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ufkAbhulnKJ7uDpi09TXOQ__original/img/hhBc0bcNj9U3t-4trByrjrO8-ro=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7127448.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ufkAbhulnKJ7uDpi09TXOQ__small/img/XBP7p0D1bkzDXkoOuXSiavW26Ig=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7127448.jpg"],"designer":["Laskas:133501","Jonny Pac:69851","Yoma:80839","Antonio Zax:75672"],"artist":["Andrew Bosley:40597","Vincent Dutrait:12130","Yoma:80839"],"publisher":["Fantasia Games:45228","Frosted Games:29895","GaGa Games:29194","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Keep Exploring Games:26840","Lucky Duck Games:33626","Maldito Games:30677","Mosaico Jogos:44349","Regatul Jocurilor:44241","TLAMA games:41423"],"category":["Medical:2145","Post-Napoleonic:2710"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","End Game Bonuses:2875","Layering:3001","Melding and Splaying:2981","Open Drafting:2041","Programmed Movement:2953","Rondel:2813","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tags:3100","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:36.9042294Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/286156/official-english-rulebook","title":"OFFICIAL ENGLISH RULEBOOK","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/286768/unconscious-mind-rules-plus-player-aid-all-expansi","title":"\u003CALL IN!\u003E - Unconscious Mind - (Rules \u002B Player Aid all expansions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/286157/official-english-solo-rulebook","title":"OFFICIAL ENGLISH SOLO RULEBOOK","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/288948/unconscious-mind-game-guide-wsetup","title":"Unconscious Mind Game Guide w/Setup","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/291663/action-andy-unconcious-mind-plus-nightmares-expans","title":"ACTION ANDY - UNCONCIOUS MIND \u002B NIGHTMARES expansion Complete Compact Rules ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

The order of who picks first depends on which tile was previously chosen, with better tiles forcing players to pick later in the next round.

Players guide the development of their tribes across several generations\u0026mdash;from nomadic hunter-gatherers to prosperous tribal societies. Over the course of the game, tribes migrate and settle new lands, establish cultural traditions, hunt paleolithic megafauna, and build everlasting megalithic structures.\n\nEndless Winter is a euro-style game that combines worker placement and deck building in an innovative way. Each round, players send their tribe members to various action spaces, and pay for the actions by playing cards and spending resources. Tribe cards grant additional labor, while Culture cards provide a variety of unique effects. As an alternative, cards can be saved for an end-of-round Eclipse phase, where they are simultaneously revealed to determine the new player order, and trigger various bonus actions.\n\nThe game features a novel blend of interwoven systems and mechanisms, such as multi-use cards, area influence, tile placement, and set collection. Plus, there are many viable paths to victory. After four brisk rounds, scores are tallied, and the tribe with the most points wins!\n\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":763587,"rank":327,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TFX_awTwbJxoG74GtRHytw__original/img/plU9ZhUubz-1LHGfbsDstEOE9vg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5624523.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TFX_awTwbJxoG74GtRHytw__small/img/gUl5oqRjGtrEIBlTDCDnfm_m1Wg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5624523.jpg"],"designer":["Stan Kordonskiy:98387"],"artist":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski:70533","Yoma:80839"],"publisher":["Fantasia Games:45228","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Frosted Games:29895","GaGa Games:29194","Galakta:4617","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Guf Studios:47012","Little Rocket Games:44898","Lucky Duck Games:33626","Mandoo Games:30521","Matagot:5400","Pegasus Spiele:39","Regatul Jocurilor:44241","TCG Factory:38448","TLAMA games:41423","White Goblin Games:4932","\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0433:44209"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Prehistoric:1036","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Income:2902","Modular Board:2011","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Set Collection:2004","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Turn Order: Auction:2827","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:36.9042635Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/250003/endless-winter-paleoamericans-setup-guide","title":"Endless Winter: Paleoamericans Setup Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/250734/endless-winter-paleoamericans-game-guide","title":"Endless Winter: Paleoamericans Game Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/264318/official-english-rulebook","title":"OFFICIAL ENGLISH RULEBOOK","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/248142/easy-setup-guide","title":"Easy Setup guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/265896/quick-start-for-endless-winter","title":"Quick Start for Endless Winter","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/264322/official-english-solo-rulebook","title":"OFFICIAL ENGLISH SOLO RULEBOOK","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":206718,"name":"Ethnos","year":2017,"description":"In Ethnos, players call upon the support of giants, merfolk, halflings, minotaurs, and other fantasy tribes to help them gain control of the land. After three ages of play, whoever has collected the most glory wins!\n\nIn more detail, the land of Ethnos contains twelve tribes of fantasy creatures, and in each game you choose six of them (five in a 2/3-player game), then create a deck with only the creatures in those tribes. The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos. Place three glory tokens in each region at random, arranging them from low to high.\n\nEach player starts the game with one card in hand, then 4-12 cards (double the number of players) are placed face up on the table. On a turn, a player either recruits an ally or plays a band of allies. In the former case, you take a face-up card (without replacing it from the deck) or the top card of the deck and add it to your hand. In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one token in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played.\n\nAt the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token. After the second age, the players with the most and second most tokens score glory equal to the values shown on the first and second tokens respectively. Players score similarly after the third age, then whoever has the most glory wins. (Games with two and three players last only two ages.)\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":45,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":745784,"rank":330,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UIKUXkcnH3Bd4fjcPGINcA__original/img/IrqDqjjm1LY66Zkw7l4RwppaBBI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3304124.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UIKUXkcnH3Bd4fjcPGINcA__small/img/oNhw2e_wcBc37ItkTRZVio2gMGQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3304124.png"],"designer":["Paolo Mori:7640"],"artist":["John Howe:11884"],"publisher":["CMON Global Limited:21608","Asterion Press:15889","BoardM Factory:25074","Conclave Editora:11043","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Edge Entertainment:2973","Lavka Games:34801","Portal Games:2726","REXhry:21053","Spaghetti Western Games:26720","\u041D\u0435\u0441\u043A\u0443\u0447\u043D\u044B\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044B:28082","\u682A\u5F0F\u4F1A\u793E\u30B1\u30F3\u30D3\u30EB (KenBill):37975"],"category":["Fantasy:1010"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Hand Management:2040","Open Drafting:2041","Push Your Luck:2661","Set Collection:2004"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:36.9043069Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/146619/ethnos-rulebook","title":"Ethnos Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/147456/ethnos-quick-rules-guide","title":"Ethnos Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/149140/ethnos-rule-summary-and-tribe-descriptions","title":"Ethnos - Rule Summary \u0026 Tribe Descriptions","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/182330/ethnos-summary-rules-and-tribes","title":"Ethnos summary: Rules \u0026 tribes","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194183/ethnos-rules-in-brief","title":"Ethnos - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Players might take the role of agents bolstering the old order or scheme to bring the kingdom to ruin. The consequences of one game will ripple through those that follow, changing what resources and actions future players may have at their disposal and even altering the game\u0027s core victory condition.\n\nIf a player seizes control by courting anarchy and distrust, future players will have to contend with a land overrun by thieves and petty warlords. In a later game, a warlord might attempt to found a dynasty, creating a line of rulers that might last generations or be crushed by the rise of a terrible, arcane cult.\n\nIn Oath, there are no fancy production tricks, app-assisted mechanisms or production gimmicks. The game can be reset at any time and doesn\u0027t require the same play group from one game to the next. A player might use the fully-featured solo mode to play several generations during the week and then use that same copy of the game for Saturday game-night with friends.

But not every employee is up to every task, so you must choose and lead your employees wisely \u0026mdash; especially since each employee grants a unique bonus and some of these bonuses generate prestige points.\n\nAfter seven rounds, the game ends with the big ball and a final scoring.

Five competing schools trained their adepts through brutal regimes, and once fully prepared, these now-recognized witchers set off to explore the land, seeking trouble and adventures and helping others for coin.\n\nIn this competitive adventure board game, 2-5 players travel across a vast map, embarking on masterfully penned quests, encountering and making ambiguous moral choices, fighting monsters \u0026mdash; and sometimes brawling with other witchers to defend their school\u0027s honor!\n\nThe game lets players construct their own unique decks of cards by choosing from a wide range of abilities: attacks, dodges, and witcher combat magic \u0026mdash; known as \u0022signs\u0022. Through card synergy, players aim to achieve powerful combos as they utilize their witcher school\u0027s hallmark abilities to their full potential. Quests, battles, and even dice poker allow each player to earn money, obtain new items, and train their skills.\n\nThe first player to acquire 4-6 trophies, with the number being set at the start of play, wins the game instantly. You can obtain trophies by killing monsters, instigating and winning chaotic tavern brawls against another witcher, training attributes to their highest level, and resolving certain quests throughout their adventure.\n\nThe game will include a Solo Mode that will allow for a solitaire adventure on the Continent.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":90,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":789623,"rank":334,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tQVVSXcmYLvAoI28cp-2Tg__original/img/0JwC_ndrsYO3hkawTSLpdf9huKc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5974859.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tQVVSXcmYLvAoI28cp-2Tg__small/img/ahKWaUSws5zja4feB4VexkNV3Mc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5974859.jpg"],"designer":["\u0141ukasz Wo\u017Aniak:51428"],"artist":["Bogna Gawro\u0144ska:111058","Damien Mammoliti:38179"],"publisher":["CD Projekt RED:7297","Go On Board:37558","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Conclave Editora:11043","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Dexker Games:31071","Fantasmagoria:22560","GaGa Games:29194","Geekach LLC:58739","Gen-X Games:8351","Ion Game Design:28765","Korea Boardgames:8291","Matagot:5400","Pendragon Game Studio:27654","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Surfin\u0027 Meeple China:36763","Yayoi The Dreamer:42760"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Fantasy:1010","Fighting:1046","Novel-based:1093","Travel:1097","Video Game Theme:1101"],"mechanic":["Card Play Conflict Resolution:2857","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Dice Rolling:2072","Events:2850","Hand Management:2040","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Open Drafting:2041","Pick-up and Deliver:2007","Point to Point Movement:2078","Race:2876","Role Playing:2028","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:36.9043472Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/259481/witcher-old-world-rules-summary-handouts-55-x-85","title":"Witcher: Old World - Rules Summary Handouts (5.5\u0022 x 8.5\u0022)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/270321/mages-expansion-deck","title":"Mages Expansion Deck","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/260792/quick-reference-rule-book-to-find-easy-to-miss-rul","title":"Quick Reference Rule Book to find easy to miss rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/293532/witcher-the-old-world-play-all-expansions-combined","title":"Witcher the Old World - Play All expansions combined and alternating Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/283157/the-witcher-old-world-mounts-expansion-fan-made-ru","title":"The Witcher: Old World - Mounts Expansion [Fan-made Rulebook \u002B Components]","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/285000/the-witcher-old-world-bards-expansion-fan-made-rul","title":"The Witcher: Old World - Bards Expansion [Fan-made Rulebook \u002B Components]","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/284028/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-the-witcher-old-world","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers THE WITCHER: OLD WORLD Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/264991/rulebooks-unofficial-solo-automa-the-witcher-old-w","title":"Rulebooks - Unofficial Solo Automa - The Witcher: Old World","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/284555/the-witcher-old-world-renown-expansion-fan-made-ru","title":"The Witcher: Old World - Renown Expansion [Fan-made Rulebook \u002B Components]","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/262585/the-witcher-old-world-official-english-rulebook","title":"The Witcher: Old World - Official English Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/264649/iconography-guide-color-version","title":"Iconography Guide Color version","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/304090/legendary-hunt-cooperative-mode","title":"Legendary Hunt Cooperative Mode","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/260220/wild-hunt-hounds-large-card-for-use-in-competitive","title":"Wild Hunt Hounds: Large card for use in competitive play","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/262078/index-for-the-base-game-rulesbook-witcher-old-worl","title":"INDEX for the Base Game Rulesbook: Witcher Old World","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

You build the tracks, upgrade towns, improve your train, and grab the right goods to make the longest, most profitable deliveries. Score your deliveries and add to your income or victory points, balancing your need to invest against your quest to win the game.\n\nSteam contains a beautiful, double-sided game board. The map on each side depicts terrain, towns, and cities at the start of the railway age. The map of the northeastern USA and neighboring Canada is ideal for 3 or 4 players.

At the start of a turn, players Gather Power, then, during a series of Action Rounds, they spend this Power to accomplish various tasks, such as recruiting Cultists, moving units, engaging in battle, summoning monsters, building Gates, casting spells, and Awakening their Great Old One. When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor *if* he has unlocked all six of spell books.\n\nDriving the strategy are a player\u0027s wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction\u0027s spell books. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books.

But it\u0027s also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a \u0022run\u0022; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players\u0027 disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario\u0026rsquo;s obstacles.\n\nYou usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you\u0027ll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time.\n\nThe base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which \u0026mdash; Asylum \u0026mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120\u002B cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers. An insert allows players to \u0022save\u0022 the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it\u0027s possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.\n\n--description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":73511,"rank":341,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XmwCsjQ3C1Ul53ZN2o8Q-Q__original/img/sUuboe9L4_nrIokyjAE74uklCjE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2617634.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XmwCsjQ3C1Ul53ZN2o8Q-Q__small/img/tTU1YVtab-cN5gCdagINowvVA2g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2617634.png"],"designer":["Peggy Chassenet:87947","Manuel Rozoy:69927"],"artist":["Ben Carre:17988","Vincent Dutrait:12130","David Lecossu:49383","Pascal Quidault:14878"],"publisher":["Space Cowboys:25842","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Asterion Press:15889","CrowD Games:34522","Delight:40244","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby Japan:1391","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Puzzle:1028","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Cooperative Game:2023","Dice Rolling:2072","Move Through Deck:2962","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Storytelling:2027","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:39.5384418Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/127627/time-stories-rulebook-11","title":"Time Stories Rulebook 1.1","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/134553/time-stories-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"TIME Stories - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132965/time-stories-presentation-to-introduce-the-rookies","title":"T.I.M.E.

{"bgg_id":50,"name":"Lost Cities","year":1999,"description":"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u0026ndash;10 in five different colors with three special \u0022handshakes\u0022 (\u0022HS\u0022 in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player\u0027s turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition\u0027s value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, \u0026times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8\u002B cards.\n\nScoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, \u0026times;2 for the multiplier.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":725573,"rank":342,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AL5D-dXabY-Lk3PqIFk_0g__original/img/PdGBQ7xc0GA9ndKnnInx_sQwvl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4597095.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AL5D-dXabY-Lk3PqIFk_0g__small/img/Q-76aN92M3OveMp26t7b0i7V-i4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4597095.jpg"],"designer":["Reiner Knizia:2"],"artist":["Vincent Dutrait:12130","Michaela Kienle:26874","Dennis Lohausen:12484","Anke Pohl:22516","Thilo Rick:22515","Claus Stephan:11902","Franz Vohwinkel:11883","\u5F90\u6600\u4EAB (Xu Yunxiang):110401","\u674E\u5C0F\u5A1C (LI Xiaona):158240","\u6768\u9759\u96EF (Yang Jingwen):158239","\u90ED\u7D2B\u9896 (Guo Ziying):158505","\u9648\u6770 (Chen Jie):158244"],"publisher":["KOSMOS:37","999 Games:267","Albi:4304","Competo / Marektoy:4335","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Galakta:4617","Gameland \u6E38\u620F\u5927\u9646:38209","Group SNE:1386","IELLO:8923","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Korea Boardgames:8291","Land of Beautiful Mind (\u0633\u0631\u0632\u0645\u06CC\u0646 \u0630\u0647\u0646 \u0632\u06CC\u0628\u0627):40841","Laser plus:5597","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Midgaard Games:3395","Nasza Ksi\u0119garnia:34627","Piatnik:22","Playhouse Ltd:19148","Rio Grande Games:3","Stupor Mundi:9235","SuperHeated Neurons:48279","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Thames \u0026 Kosmos:60627","Tilsit:42","Yaofish Games:54519","Zvezda:1466","\u06AF\u06CC\u0645\u0650 \u067E\u0646\u062F\u0648 (Pendo Games):47140"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Exploration:1020","Math:1104"],"mechanic":["Hand Management:2040","Melding and Splaying:2981","Ordering:3101","Push Your Luck:2661","Score-and-Reset Game:2823","Set Collection:2004"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:39.5384999Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/7057/universal-head-lost-cities-rules-summary","title":"Universal Head LOST CITIES Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/116837/lost-cities-the-original-card-game-by-thames-and-k","title":"Lost Cities: The Original Card Game by Thames \u0026 Kosmos","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/96270/solo-variant-rules","title":"Solo variant rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/69093/lost-city-rules-pocketmodded","title":"Lost City Rules Pocketmodded","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/34366/lost-cities-concise-rules-refresher","title":"Lost Cities concise rules refresher","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131259/lost-cities-solitaire-alternative","title":"Lost Cities - Solitaire alternative","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131258/lost-cities-4-player-alternative","title":"Lost Cities - 4 Player alternative","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/28977/manual-score-sheet","title":"Manual Score Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":108745,"name":"Seasons","year":2012,"description":"The greatest sorcerers of the kingdom have gathered at the heart of the Argos forest, where the legendary tournament of the 12 seasons is taking place. At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!\n\nSeasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:\n\nThe first phase \u0022Prelude\u0022 consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.\n\nOnce the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.\n\nNext comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players \u002B1).\n\nThese cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: \n- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) \n- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards\n- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. \n- Draw new cards\n\nEach player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the \u0022time track\u0022 would move forward.\nIn addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the \u0022exchange rates\u0022 of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.\n\nAt the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":733662,"rank":343,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/awmZ9rYy-hTgea6Vdp_OoQ__original/img/bQ_yFa_JI_B8y3N4nfXcXYU_tE0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1299390.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/awmZ9rYy-hTgea6Vdp_OoQ__small/img/OBVCWq284XUhX2sKlMwoilFfuGk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1299390.jpg"],"designer":["R\u00E9gis Bonness\u00E9e:1532"],"artist":["R\u00E9gis Bonness\u00E9e:1532","Xavier Gueniffey Durin:36093","St\u00E9phane Gantiez:12402"],"publisher":["Libellud:9051","Asterion Press:15889","CrowD Games:34522","Geekach LLC:58739","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby Japan:1391","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","SD Games:33010","sternenschimmermeer:39249","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Fantasy:1010"],"mechanic":["Closed Drafting:2984","Dice Rolling:2072","Die Icon Resolution:2856","Hand Management:2040","Open Drafting:2041","Tags:3100","Take That:2686","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Victory Points as a Resource:2874"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:39.53854Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/78563/rules-english-from-libellud","title":"Rules (English) from Libellud","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/78451/rules-in-english","title":"Rules in english","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/105043/seasons-reference-sheet","title":"Seasons Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/98752/player-reference-card","title":"Player Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/94477/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/97508/seasons-dutch-rules","title":"Seasons Dutch Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131509/seasons-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Seasons - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/253801/official-additional-rules-for-base-game-plus-faq","title":"Official Additional Rules for base game \u002B FAQ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/124157/seasons-gameplay-concept-map","title":"Seasons gameplay concept-map","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this card\u0026mdash;but not too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller then lays out the cards, and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller. If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller\u0027s card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller.

Points are primarily gained by mapping the land, water, and sky. Players can also gain points from upgrading their caravans, by gaining inspiration from nobles, and by influencing the three guilds of science, trade and exploration.

Send and defend against armies and minions, build towers to protect your base, and explore with your heroes in search of resources and powerful Relics to turn the tide of battle.\n\nTaking place in the floating realm of Ankar, Cloudspire tells the story of a war to acquire a powerful and rare energy known only as \u0022the source.\u0022 Every race has their own unique units and heroes as well as the ability to bid and draft mercenaries for hire.\n\nArmies are placed either individually or in stacks to conceal powerful units until the last possible moments. Heroes, in the meantime, are controlled individually and may join the tide of battle or choose to explore points of interest in search of numerous resources. Meanwhile, the event deck regularly changes the terms of the fight, making every wave exciting and unpredictable.\n\nAs armies and minions approach opposing bases, they\u0027ll need to contend with Spires - powerful defense towers that can be built around the board.

{"bgg_id":19777,"name":"Indonesia","year":2005,"description":"Judging by the smirk on the face of the Sultan of Solo, the businessman from North Sumatra has just made a mistake. And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan\u0026rsquo;s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash \u0026mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait \u0026mdash; what\u0026rsquo;s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook \u0026hellip; considerably, in fact \u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s see\u0026hellip;\n\nIndonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city\u0027s capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.\n\nPlayers keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":180,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":789455,"rank":350,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H1nnDvsIaK-Hj8vOT-wYfQ__original/img/bV61N2g6P4ubLKtUL4yvjY1ielM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8210703.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H1nnDvsIaK-Hj8vOT-wYfQ__small/img/BfVGmWkk0c7vszRhu7UF2AWDjO4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8210703.jpg"],"designer":["Jeroen Doumen:270","Joris Wiersinga:407"],"artist":["Jeroen Kesselaar:12603","Jan Lipi\u0144ski:141525","Ynze Moedt:12602"],"publisher":["Splotter Spellen:140","One Moment Games:30552"],"category":["Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Transportation:1011"],"mechanic":["Auction / Bidding:2012","End Game Bonuses:2875","Income:2902","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Network and Route Building:2081","Open Drafting:2041","Ownership:2911","Pick-up and Deliver:2007","Simulation:2070","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Auction:2827","Variable Set-up:2897","Victory Points as a Resource:2874","Zone of Control:2974"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:39.5388813Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/20219/indonesia-epdf","title":"indonesia_E.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56085/summary-reference-sheet","title":"Summary - Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/46406/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"Concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/291960/indonesia-tutorial-and-setup-guide","title":"Indonesia Tutorial \u0026 Setup Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/177020/indonesia-teaching-outline-rules-guide","title":"Indonesia Teaching Outline Rules Guide ","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81507/indonesia-dutch-rules-pf","title":"Indonesia Dutch rules PF","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":111341,"name":"The Great Zimbabwe","year":2012,"description":"The Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa. It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.\n\nIn the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.\n\nHere\u0027s the flavour text from the rules:\n\nThe Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. \u0026ldquo;Oondabezitha \u0026rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, \u0026ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight\u0026rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. \u0026ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala\u0026rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. \u0026ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own\u0026rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...\n\n\nThe Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.\n\nBuying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in \u0027The Great Zimbabwe\u0027. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.\n\nClever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! \u0027The Great Zimbabwe\u0027 is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players\u0027 decisions change everything...\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":90,"max_time":150,"avg_rating":78444,"rank":356,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__original/img/gtQ1AZ8xqbjEq9KhLK6aoz9TQm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1400856.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__small/img/tGLIa6i13UQJv2-Xj47XEHZrDRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1400856.jpg"],"designer":["Jeroen Doumen:270","Joris Wiersinga:407"],"artist":["Ynze Moedt:12602"],"publisher":["Splotter Spellen:140"],"category":["Civilization:1015","Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Transportation:1011"],"mechanic":["Auction / Bidding:2012","Income:2902","Market:2900","Modular Board:2011","Network and Route Building:2081","Open Drafting:2041","Ownership:2911","Square Grid:2940","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Auction:2827","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:39.539109Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/83667/the-great-zimbabwe-english-rulebook","title":"The Great Zimbabwe - English rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132794/the-great-zimbabwe-complete-condensed-rules","title":"The Great Zimbabwe complete condensed rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/94472/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/151421/tgz-rules-refresher","title":"TGZ Rules Refresher","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/281355/the-great-zimbabwe-teaching-guide","title":"The Great Zimbabwe Teaching Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

The player who succeeds in doing this best becomes the new \u0022Obermufti\u0022 of Marrakesh.\n\nMarrakesh is played over three rounds, with each round consisting of four turns. On each turn, players simultaneously and secretly choose three colored cylinders from behind their screen. Then, in turn order, they place matching colored assistants on their player board (these will be the actions they will perform later), then all cylinders are placed in the cube tower. The cube tower randomizes which cylinders are available this round, with some getting stuck and some from previous rounds coming out.\n\nIn turn order, players select a color and take 1-2 of the cylinders that have passed through the tower (or those that were stuck from a previous round but have now emerged) and place them on their player boards. These cylinders will enhance future actions taken in the same color in future rounds. Then, in turn order players will activate the regions where they have placed an assistant.\n\nActions allow players to gain wealth, which can be traded for influence in the city.

{"bgg_id":176734,"name":"The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire","year":2016,"description":"From the ashes of war, nations rise to power in the atomic age. Each player takes control of a nation struggling for power in the latter part of the 20th century. They build up their nation\u0026rsquo;s industry, commerce, and government by acquiring resources, building structures, and tapping sources of energy. The price of oil is going up, and nuclear energy is the wave of the future. The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire is set in the same \u0022universe\u0022 as The Manhattan Project, but it\u0027s a standalone game, not an expansion.\n\nThe major threat in Energy Empire is not war, but uncertain global impacts, that result from side effects of industrialization and pollution. Many actions come with a cost. So, as nations become more industrious, they also increase the amount of pollution in the environment.  Careful use of science can mitigate the harmful effects of industry, and can also help avert global crises.\n\nEnergy Empire uses worker placement, tableau-building, and resource management mechanics. On each turn, a player can choose to either work or generate. On a work turn, a player plays a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau. Players may spend energy to use an occupied space on the main board, so no spaces are ever completely blocked. On a generate turn, players get to renew their supply of energy by rolling \u0022energy dice\u0022 that represent nuclear, coal, oil, solar, and other forms of energy.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":772257,"rank":361,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-aaspZ2Oq1VuAADvbUoeww__original/img/fr4sH1ViKPtRys-gjCY4dY8UuQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3048617.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-aaspZ2Oq1VuAADvbUoeww__small/img/6nMV_Bdtm2ShipBJfGle36DY1-U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3048617.jpg"],"designer":["Tom Jolly:222","Luke Laurie:63686"],"artist":["Josh Cappel:9731","Jeffrey Edwards:88808"],"publisher":["Minion Games:13433","Doit Games:39751","Playfun Games:34744"],"category":["Dice:1017","Economic:1021","Environmental:1084","Industry / Manufacturing:1088"],"mechanic":["Contracts:2912","Dice Rolling:2072","Die Icon Resolution:2856","End Game Bonuses:2875","Events:2850","Income:2902","Market:2900","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Open Drafting:2041","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tags:3100","Track Movement:2939","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Worker Placement:2082","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types:2933"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:42.3428997Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/134506/the-manhattan-project-energy-empire-rules","title":"The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150060/mp-energy-empire-solo-deck-rules-clash-of-nations","title":"MP Energy Empire Solo Deck Rules \u0022Clash of Nations\u0022","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/157815/energy-empire-quick-rules-guide","title":"Energy Empire Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/197831/the-manhattan-project-energy-empire-rules-in-brief","title":"The Manhattan Project Energy Empire - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":5,"name":"Acquire","year":1963,"description":"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.\n\nHistory of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\n\nMany books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of \u0022Vacations\u0022 from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called \u0022ACQUIRE.\u0022 3M\u0027s original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid\u0027s idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid\u0027s original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid\u0027s original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.\n\nDecember 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition\n1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay \u0026 stocks with printed backs\n1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay \u0026 stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)\n1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay \u0026 non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)\n1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)\n1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board\n1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company\n1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       \u0026 86)\n1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)\n1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions\n1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro\n1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks \u0026 money, large info cards\n2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast\n2006 - Lloyd\u0027s (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson\u0027s original ideas. Lloyd Solon\u0027s Rules help players to correct poor strategy during the beginning of the game that can been seen with new and unexperienced players (running out of money soon is the main mistake that must be omitted!).  \n2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board \u0026 tiles, redesigned stocks \u0026 money\n2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition. It looks at first sight to be similar to previous modern editions, but has been criticised for the use of inferior design choices such as hard-to-read grey-on-grey embossed slots and the unusual tile fonts. It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson\u0027s original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.\n2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode \u0026mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus. \n2024 - The Renegade 60th Anniversary edition includes a set of plastic weighted poker chips, and Special Powers Variant cards.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":90,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":735551,"rank":362,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gIQlWhlaqjPiunZjjwz_XA__original/img/ZRnstiRspAWMorOn6UKoKx9ibwI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8483227.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gIQlWhlaqjPiunZjjwz_XA__small/img/f06arYYwY_QZmOnAbQhhg-6mIUo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8483227.jpg"],"designer":["Sid Sackson:4"],"artist":["Eric Hibbeler:107207","Scott O\u0027Gara:132062","Scott Okumura:12658","Anita Osburn:96753","Peter Whitley:18317"],"publisher":["3M:92","The Avalon Hill Game Co:5","Arclight Games:3475","Avalon Hill:4871","Banana Games:35928","Broadway Toys LTD:9068","Dujardin:3082","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos:858","Korea Boardgames:8291","PS-Games:2962","Renegade Game Studios:28072","Schmidt France:5392","Schmidt International:4668","Schmidt Spiele:38","Selecta Spel en Hobby:4622","Smart Games, Inc.:7107","Yayoi The Dreamer:42760"],"category":["Economic:1021","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Connections:2883","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Hidden Victory Points:2987","Income:2902","Investment:2910","Market:2900","Pattern Building:2048","Square Grid:2940","Stock Holding:2005","Tile Placement:2002","Victory Points as a Resource:2874"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:42.3429271Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/40242/acquire-rule-summary-and-teaching-aid","title":"Acquire - Rule Summary \u0026 Teaching Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/2672/how-to-play-acquiredoc","title":"HOW TO PLAY ACQUIRE.doc","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/11038/acquire-quick-referencepdf","title":"Acquire - Quick Reference.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56645/acquire-pocket-rules-for-new-players","title":"Acquire pocket rules for new players","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/67474/teaching-guide-for-acquire-from-the-how-to-play-po","title":"Teaching Guide for Acquire from The How to Play Podcast","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/41467/acquire-information-card-to-replace-black-rule-ins","title":"Acquire Information Card to replace black rule insert","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/62448/original-1962-rules-for-acquire-variant","title":"Original 1962 Rules for Acquire (Variant)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/4891/acquire-rulesdoc","title":"ACQUIRE rules.doc","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/121420/acquire-reference-card-for-2008-edition","title":"Acquire Reference Card for 2008 Edition","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/1066/acquire-variant-merger-rulepdf","title":"Acquire Variant Merger Rule.PDF","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194423/acquire-1960s-version-reference-for-poker-chips","title":"Acquire (1960s version) Reference for Poker Chips","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and you must rely on others to take your romantic letters to her.

Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette\u0027s hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!\n\nNumber 4 in the Setting: Tempest Shared World Game Series\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":20,"max_time":20,"avg_rating":72259,"rank":366,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T1ltXwapFUtghS9A7_tf4g__original/img/xIAzJY7rl-mtPStRZSqnTVsAr8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1401448.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T1ltXwapFUtghS9A7_tf4g__small/img/GtNX7gCmGpw39Tr6JApWC3Aga5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1401448.jpg"],"designer":["Seiji Kanai:9495"],"artist":["Kali Fitzgerald:58973","Andrew Hepworth:14344","Jeff Himmelman:14593","John Kovalic:6815","Nina Matsumoto:117030","Robb Miller:84471","Ken Niimura:90409","Noboru Sugiura:12439","Yating Sun:78958","\u7530\u4E2D\u5BDB\u5D07 (Tanaka Hirotaka):139869"],"publisher":["Alderac Entertainment Group:396","Kanai Factory:7552","(Web published):1001","963.com:26885","999 Games:267","Arclight Games:3475","asmodee:157","Bard Centrum Gier:9074","Black Monk:12031","BoardM Factory:25074","Brain Games:7162","cutia.ro:24631","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Devir:2366","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","Gentosha Education:10215","Hobby World:18852","HomoLudicus:6275","Japon Brand:5885","Kaissa Chess \u0026 Games:6214","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Magpie (Korean Co):26138","MINDOK:7992","Pegasus Spiele:39","Popcorn Games:41167","Siam Board Games:33998","Steve Jackson Games:19","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","uplay.it edizioni:17786","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Deduction:1039","Renaissance:1070"],"mechanic":["Deduction:3002","Hand Management:2040","Player Elimination:2685","Score-and-Reset Game:2823","Take That:2686"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:42.3429758Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/86451/rules-formatted-to-fit-a-25-x-35-card","title":"Rules formatted to fit a 2.5 x 3.5 card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/97958/love-letter-rules-summary-2-pages","title":"Love Letter Rules Summary (2-pages)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/85998/rule-and-card-changes-between-the-japon-brand-and","title":"Rule and Card changes between the Japon Brand and AEG versions, reference card","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/112956/player-aid-reference-sheet-for-the-kanai-factory-e","title":"Player Aid / Reference Sheet for the Kanai Factory Edition","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/117445/playing-card-version-reference-card","title":"Playing card version reference card","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords.

{"bgg_id":276182,"name":"Dead Reckoning","year":2022,"description":"Dead Reckoning is a game of exploration, piracy, and influence based in a Caribbean-esque setting. Each player commands a ship and crew and seeks to amass the greatest fortune. They do this through pirating, trading, treasure hunting, and (importantly) capturing and maintaining control over the uninhabited but resource-rich islands of the region. During the game, you can:\n\n\u0026bull; Customize your ship: Your ship is represented by a token on the board. The board starts mostly unexplored and will be revealed as you venture into uncharted waters. You also have a ship board where you load cargo and treasure, and you can customize the guns, speed, or holding space of your ship.\n\n\u0026bull; Card-craft your crew: You have a small deck of cards that will drive your actions in the game, with each card representing one of your crew members. This deck functions like one in a deck-building game, but the cards in the deck are sleeved, and rather than add new crew cards to your deck, you improve the skill and abilities of your crew cards by placing transparent \u0022advancement\u0022 cards in those sleeves. Aside from the transparent advancements, your crew will also \u0022level up\u0022 naturally during the game using a new card-leveling mechanism not seen in other card-crafting games such as Mystic Vale.\n\n\u0026bull; Control the region: The region is filled with many deserted islands. These islands are a major source of treasure, and players will battle for control of these islands.\n\n\u0026bull; Battle via a dynamic cube-tower: You can battle other players\u0027 ships or NPC merchant ships, and these battles are resolved via a new take on what a cube tower can be, with crew cards and ship powers increasing your chances of victory.\n\n\u0026bull; Uncover secrets of the sea: Expansions for Dead Reckoning use a \u0022saga\u0022 system in which certain content remains hidden and is discovered and added to the game organically only via playing. Rather than add everything at once, you gradually add it by playing and discovering.

Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.\n\nThe game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.\n\n(Based on a description from Czech Games Edition)\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":73792,"rank":372,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__original/img/ccy5tGJK7WF9B6ykayJEm5cReTM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic384313.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__small/img/9tewdwxUKcqikj0QlVSUmwRPK68=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic384313.jpg"],"designer":["Vlaada Chv\u00E1til:789"],"artist":["Radim Pech:11938","Milan Vavro\u0148:11961"],"publisher":["Czech Games Edition:7345","Albi:4304","asmodee:157","Devir:2366","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","HomoLudicus:6275","IELLO:8923","Magellan:23031","New Games Order, LLC:9881","One Moment Games:30552","Quined White Goblin Games:4696","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Red Glove:6123","Rio Grande Games:3"],"category":["Electronic:1072","Real-time:1037","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113"],"mechanic":["Action Queue:2689","Area Movement:2046","Cooperative Game:2023","Elapsed Real Time Ending:2882","Hand Management:2040","Programmed Movement:2953","Real-Time:2831","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:42.3430719Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/35898/space-alert-rulebook-english","title":"Space Alert Rulebook - English","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/57743/little-duckling-new-board-rules-and-missions-for-a","title":"Little Duckling: New Board, Rules and Missions for a true 1-3 player experience (Board v2.0)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/57744/little-duckling-new-board-rules-and-missions-for-a","title":"Little Duckling: New Board, Rules and Missions for a true 1-3 player experience (Handbook v2.0)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/81724/space-alert-rules-reference","title":"Space Alert Rules Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/75220/space-alert-rules-summary-chart","title":"Space Alert Rules Summary chart","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/46420/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"Concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/77384/summary-file-20-with-expansion-rules-summarized","title":"Summary File 2.0 (with Expansion Rules Summarized)","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":308119,"name":"Pax Renaissance: 2nd Edition","year":2021,"description":"Pax Renaissance 2nd Edition is a game for 1 to 4 players where you play as a banker in Europe at the height of the Renaissance during the late 15th and early 16th-century.\n\nA time when European nobility and warlords declined and the arts and technology advanced in the wake of a new economic force:  merchants and bankers.  These bankers became the wealthiest private individuals ever as they guided Europe into the modern age.\n\nAs a Renaissance banker, you will finance kings or republics, sponsor voyages of discovery, join secret cabals, or unleash jihads and inquisitions. Your choices determine if Europe is elevated into the bright modern era or remains festering in dark feudalism. Four victories determine the future course of Western Society: will it be towards imperialism, trade globalization, religious totalitarianism, or enlightened art and science?\n\nNew components include punchouts for pirate ships, pawns for concessions and serfs, placards for player boards, and empire squares allowing storage of repressed tokens and queens even if the King is not in a player Tableau.\n\nExtra game Map Cards are included, allowing the mounted gameboard to be left behind for small game portability. Useful if you have limited space in your game bag.\n\nExpanded rules include Dalmatians, Cryptography, Condottiere, apostasy, and the solitaire game. Strategy and Frequently-Asked Questions are included.\n\nContains Pax Renaissance Expansion and Pax Renaissance: BGG Promo Pack.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":838913,"rank":373,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qMUEv_3tTAIvaueey5g2Jg__original/img/d2RzbsmaPHhv3zEaSgRYdoBAqC4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6230160.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qMUEv_3tTAIvaueey5g2Jg__small/img/9zOYaIAYSZblU54nf0wZlPnyjU8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6230160.png"],"designer":["Phil Eklund:174","Matt Eklund:2085"],"artist":["Josefin Strand:125415"],"publisher":["Ion Game Design:28765","Sierra Madre Games:101","500 Nuances de Geek:35738","CrowD Games:34522","Galakta:4617"],"category":["Pike and Shot:2725","Religious:1115","Renaissance:1070"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Market:2900","Open Drafting:2041","Simulation:2070"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:42.3430827Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/233036/unofficial-revised-pax-renaissance-2nd-edition-rul","title":"UNOFFICIAL Revised Pax Renaissance 2nd Edition Rulebook v1.4","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/222621/pax-renaissance-2nd-edition-rules-simplified","title":"Pax Renaissance 2nd Edition - rules simplified","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/246732/how-to-do-common-tasks-player-aid-v13","title":"How To Do Common Tasks - Player Aid v1.3","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/250750/pr2e-quick-battle-reference","title":"PR2e - Quick Battle Reference!","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/251192/thematic-reference-guide","title":"Thematic Reference Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/203694/pax-renaissance-2-three-page-reference","title":"Pax Renaissance 2 Three Page Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/268728/paxren-2ed-player-aid-all-rules-in-2-a4-pages-plus","title":"PaxRen 2ed Player Aid - All rules in 2 A4 pages \u002B conflicts diagrams","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/277286/pr2e-reference-and-alternative-banker-cards","title":"PR2e - Reference \u0026 Alternative Banker Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

For the expansion to regular Power Grid see Power Grid: Europe/North America.\n\nFor the 10th anniversary of the highly successful game Power Grid we present this new deluxe version including brand new components. Wait for a huge double-sided game board presenting Europe and North America, newly customized wooden parts and an entire deck of new power plants, some of which use natural gas instead of garbage. New overview cards for the resource refill improve game play. An exciting new two players experience is also added - \u0026ldquo;Against the Trust\u0026rdquo;!\n\nThe game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-wracking resource speculations, city networks and the competition among the players, all the way to the tight game ending with several players fighting for the win.\n\nThe goal of Power Grid Deluxe is to supply the most cities with power when someone\u0027s network reaches a predetermined size. Players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they need to power these cities. However, as power plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you\u0027re potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nWhat\u0027s more, players must acquire the resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the \u0022renewable\u0022 windfarm plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\nNOTE: The deluxe edition came with Power Grid: The New Power Plants \u2013 Set 2, which was later released separately in 2021.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":120,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":7946,"rank":379,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pTnv3lUWs4Knl3fqer0KnA__original/img/Sna_LGQ8KH3Zz6VjEAn-YQ-8yJw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2056160.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pTnv3lUWs4Knl3fqer0KnA__small/img/lUr_hvOoCfzI9JvplDge3L1Edx4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2056160.jpg"],"designer":["Friedemann Friese:141"],"artist":["Harald Lieske:4959"],"publisher":["2F-Spiele:58","999 Games:267","Arclight Games:3475","Edge Entertainment:2973","Giochi Uniti:5530","Ideal Board Games:8822","Lautapelit.fi:3218","Rio Grande Games:3"],"category":["Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088"],"mechanic":["Auction: Turn Order Until Pass:2919","Catch the Leader:2887","Income:2902","Market:2900","Network and Route Building:2081","Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:42.3431651Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/110556/power-grid-deluxe-initial-setup-and-rules-upgrades","title":"Power Grid Deluxe - Initial setup and rules upgrades from original Power Grid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/275833/action-andy-power-grid-deluxe-complete-compact-rul","title":"ACTION ANDY - Power Grid Deluxe Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/217959/power-grid-deluxe-europenorth-america-complete-con","title":"Power Grid Deluxe: Europe/North America complete condensed rules for 3-6 players","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":234277,"name":"Nusfjord","year":2017,"description":"Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.\n\nIn the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.\n\nAs with Agricola, Caverna, and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space \u0026mdash; which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you\u0027ve visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don\u0027t take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":20,"max_time":100,"avg_rating":763933,"rank":380,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKYqNPEE94Zk_q5Vtk527w__original/img/Bf35-bzWhSF8jMq8pfzubBxuNlU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3729070.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKYqNPEE94Zk_q5Vtk527w__small/img/b380XF_C0n--whN9elUn8jI__Yg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3729070.jpg"],"designer":["Uwe Rosenberg:10"],"artist":["Patrick Soeder:41570"],"publisher":["Lookout Games:234","CrowD Games:34522","Hobby Japan:1391","Ludofy Creative:29242","Mayfair Games:10","SD Games:33010"],"category":["Economic:1021","Nautical:1008"],"mechanic":["Open Drafting:2041","Turn Order: Claim Action:2829","Worker Placement:2082"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:42.3431784Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/155001/official-english-rules","title":"Official English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/156485/nusfjord-quick-rules-guide","title":"Nusfjord Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/191930/action-andy-nusfjord-complete-compact-rules","title":"ACTION ANDY - Nusfjord Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/219722/nusfjord-setup-and-round-summary-quick-guide","title":"Nusfjord - Setup and Round Summary Quick Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/202638/nusfjord-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Nusfjord - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

The game\u0027s 105 innovations \u0026mdash; or in the fourth edition, 115 innovations \u0026mdash; are each represented by a card with a unique effect, organized into ten (or eleven) ages.

In principle, every card can be used for every action \u0026ndash; but the color of the card determines in which areas the actions can be used or the strength of the chosen action, e.g., blue cards provide blue workers and red cards help mitigate red threats.

{"bgg_id":143693,"name":"Glass Road","year":2013,"description":"The game Glass Road commemorates the 700-year-old tradition of glass-making in the Bavarian Forest. (Today, the \u0022Glass Road\u0022 is a route through the Bavarian forest that takes visitors to many of the old glass houses and museums of that region.) You must skillfully manage your glass and brick production in order to build the right structures that help you keep your business flowing. Cut the forest to keep the fires burning in the ovens, and spread and remove ponds, pits, and groves to supply yourself with the items you need. Fifteen specialists are there at your side to carry out your orders...\n\nIn more detail, the game consists of four building periods. Each player has an identical set of fifteen specialist cards, and each specialist comes with two abilities. At the beginning of each building period, you choose a hand of five specialists. If during this building period, you play a specialist that no other player has in hand, you may use both abilities on that card; if two or more players play the same specialist, each of them may use only one of the two abilities. Exploiting the abilities of these specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings, which come in three types:\n\n\n    Processing buildings\n    \u0022Immediate\u0022 buildings with a one-time effect \n    Buildings that provide bonus points at the end of the game for various accomplishments\n\n\nMastering the balance of knowing the best specialist card to play and being flexible about when you play it \u0026mdash; together with assembling a clever combination of buildings \u0026mdash; is the key to this game.\n\nThe 2021 edition of Glass Road includes previously released promotional material: the Oktoberfest and Adventskalender tiles and the Harlekin card for use in the solitaire version of the game.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":20,"max_time":80,"avg_rating":740906,"rank":384,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qJCgEh5Icl7Ed1z2F56yxg__original/img/uz0zO0sycM6HZNA3HTWW7-_ur_Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5895433.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qJCgEh5Icl7Ed1z2F56yxg__small/img/yGVr4jO888pg1GmCnukXbubTZmM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5895433.jpg"],"designer":["Uwe Rosenberg:10"],"artist":["Dennis Lohausen:12484"],"publisher":["Feuerland Spiele:22380","Capstone Games:30958","Cranio Creations:10768","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Grok Games:42325","Lacerta:5812","Maldito Games:30677","Mayfair Games:10","MTS Games:46431","\u30C6\u30F3\u30C7\u30A4\u30BA\u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u30BA (TendaysGames):22609","Toy Box Games:39794","White Goblin Games:4932","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Medieval:1035"],"mechanic":["Automatic Resource Growth:2903","End Game Bonuses:2875","Follow:2843","Open Drafting:2041","Set Collection:2004","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:45.429651Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93922/english-rules","title":"English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/131498/glass-road-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Glass Road - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/96832/glass-road-buildings-reference","title":"Glass Road Buildings Reference","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/96830/glass-road-card-reference","title":"Glass Road Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/115989/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/143861/brents-glass-road-promo-tile-english-rules","title":"Brent\u0027s Glass Road Promo Tile English Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/158410/glass-road-rules-summary","title":"Glass Road Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/197612/glass-road-rules-in-brief","title":"Glass Road - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/254400/foamcore-boxes-for-glass-road-tiles","title":"Foamcore boxes for Glass Road tiles","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":54138,"name":"Imperial 2030","year":2009,"description":"Imperial 2030 is a game on its own, based on the rules of Imperial.  The six powers (USA, Europe, Russia, China, India, and Brazil) develop their industrial basis and build up armies and fleets.  They fight over control of neutral land and sea areas in order to become the most powerful nation worldwide.\n\nIn this game it is not the players who take turns, but the six powers, one after another.  The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation\u0027s government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.  Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!\n\nImperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games.

The rest of the players can offer you cards that contain the requested references, and you can trade for those cards by giving the offering players the same number of points they have offered via cards in your hand.\n\nAfter each round ends, players can try to solve the mystery.

{"bgg_id":202426,"name":"Sidereal Confluence","year":2017,"description":"Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant is a singularly unique trading and negotiation game for 4-9 players. Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you\u0027ll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.\n\nEach player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture\u0027s economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture\u0027s outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.\n\nEach game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race\u0027s special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.\n\nThe ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.\n\nThe game is almost all simultaneous play.\n\nSidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.\n\n","min_players":4,"max_players":9,"min_time":120,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":776507,"rank":395,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__original/img/1D98HsjtX5IzcwUMvd-67z1xzKo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4981297.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__small/img/ptUAPVk_LoqX7qDUt7ngtDXe-Qw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4981297.jpg"],"designer":["TauCeti Deichmann:25517"],"artist":["Kwanchai Moriya:28024","Jesse Seidule:74997","Nakarin Sukontakorn:74781"],"publisher":["WizKids (I):221","Banana Games:35928","Frosted Games:29895","Intrafin Games:5380","Lavka Games:34801","Pegasus Spiele:39"],"category":["Economic:1021","Negotiation:1026","Real-time:1037","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113"],"mechanic":["Auction: Sealed Bid:2920","Hidden Victory Points:2987","Income:2902","Negotiation:2915","Real-Time:2831","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Trading:2008","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:45.4298124Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/151419/sidereal-confluence-teaching-guide","title":"Sidereal Confluence Teaching Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/147518/sidereal-confluence-rulebook","title":"Sidereal Confluence Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193016/sidereal-confluence-remastered-edition-rulebook","title":"Sidereal Confluence Remastered Edition Rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193017/sidereal-confluence-remastered-edition-teaching-gu","title":"Sidereal Confluence Remastered Edition Teaching Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/171359/sidereal-confluence-rules-summary","title":" Sidereal Confluence Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/182965/sidereal-confluence-race-strategy-guide-v10","title":"Sidereal Confluence Race Strategy Guide v1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/292264/faction-selection-and-reference","title":"Faction selection and reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/204443/sidereal-confluence-rules-summary-mattybrem","title":"Sidereal Confluence Rules Summary - MattyBrem","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race\u0027s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.\n\nThe Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:\n\n\n     Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!\n     Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!\n     Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!\n     Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!\n     Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!\n     Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines! \n\n\nStrategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.\n\nVictory can come only from the death of your opponent\u0027s Summoner...\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":747124,"rank":397,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JvkUZy1YS7V9GX-7JutIYg__original/img/XJ0IqhLALib3B7P91Jr2aGA7kVc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic923048.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JvkUZy1YS7V9GX-7JutIYg__small/img/iMkSFXhlP5TaEpjbfjHRhxy0XzY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic923048.jpg"],"designer":["Colby Dauch:12953"],"artist":["JJ Ariosa:29142","Gary Simpson:9798"],"publisher":["Plaid Hat Games:10754","Cube Factory of Ideas:24042","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","MINDOK:7992","Raven Distribution:3242"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Fantasy:1010","Fighting:1046"],"mechanic":["Deck Construction:3004","Dice Rolling:2072","Grid Movement:2676","Hand Management:2040","Stat Check Resolution:2853","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:45.4298549Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/76491/summoner-wars-master-set-rules-summary","title":"Summoner Wars - Master Set rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/102261/summoner-wars-attack-odds-reference-card","title":"Summoner Wars Attack Odds Reference Card","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Yet, despite their fortifications and imposing armies, rumours began spreading of a formidable foe in the lands above the Black Sea. They came on horseback. Fierce warriors, both male and female. Skilled with the sword, axe and bow. But they weren\u0026rsquo;t mindless savages. Their artisans were renowned for their ability to craft detailed trinkets of gold. They fashioned leather armour and improvised the recurve bow. They trained eagles for hunting and war. Some even believe they inspired the Greek tales of the Amazons. But they were more than legend or fable. They were the Raiders of Scythia.\n\nThe aim of Raiders of Scythia is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game\u0026rsquo;s end. VP are gained by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and completing Quests. Players will need to assemble a Crew, train Animals and gather Provisions.

This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.\n\nAlien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.\n\nThe game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system\u0026rsquo;s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.\n\nThe planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.\n\nWinning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?\n\nRoll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don\u0027t dream it\u0027ll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":734352,"rank":401,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UWZTWLXFfg_6HpXJmviL3g__original/img/1EiMWmB4iGMDRbaXuvZQtlszM_Q=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3360924.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UWZTWLXFfg_6HpXJmviL3g__small/img/KBuRMq00g4PlosEQSUUTDLzsYN8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3360924.png"],"designer":["Tory Niemann:18320"],"artist":["Piotr Burzykowski:67486","Ross Grams:76784","Mark Maxwell:15562"],"publisher":["Clever Mojo Games:9695","CMON Global Limited:21608","Game Salute:22701","Hobby World:18852","LocWorks:11199","Tycoon Games:59869","\u682A\u5F0F\u4F1A\u793E\u30B1\u30F3\u30D3\u30EB (KenBill):37975"],"category":["Dice:1017","Science Fiction:1016","Space Exploration:1113"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Dice Rolling:2072","Open Drafting:2041","Worker Placement with Dice Workers:2935"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:55.5903632Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56505/alien-frontiers-rulebook-final-version","title":"Alien Frontiers Rulebook -- Final Version","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/60510/alien-frontiers-reference","title":"Alien Frontiers Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/107441/alien-frontiers-rulebook-4th-edition-2nd-printing","title":"Alien Frontiers Rulebook, 4th Edition, 2nd Printing, English","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56373/alien-frontiers-rules-pdf","title":"Alien Frontiers Rules PDF","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71447/condensed-card-reference","title":"Condensed Card Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/256787/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-alien-frontiers-rules","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers ALIEN FRONTIERS Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/116722/alien-frontiers-rules-reference-player-aid-include","title":"Alien Frontiers - Rules Reference_Player Aid (includes Factions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68154/alien-tech-card-player-reference-versions-22-and-1","title":"Alien Tech Card Player Reference, Versions 2.2 and 1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/56396/alien-frontiers-rulebook-v1b","title":"Alien Frontiers Rulebook v1b","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/91186/player-reference-cards","title":"Player Reference Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194634/alien-frontiers-rules-in-brief","title":"Alien Frontiers - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68275/alien-frontiers-reference-sheet-alien-tech-cards","title":"Alien Frontiers Reference Sheet Alien Tech Cards","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!\n\nOn each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go \u0022into decline\u0022. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.\n\nAt the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.\n\nClarifications: available in a pinned forum post.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_time":40,"max_time":80,"avg_rating":719262,"rank":402,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__original/img/bYLzrwZO9u-3h2wyU-PHc8aTOY4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic428828.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__small/img/o3Bw9heVDJRgPYlI_PksCvLAgnM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic428828.jpg"],"designer":["Philippe Keyaerts:49"],"artist":["Miguel Coimbra:12016","Cyrille Daujean:12519"],"publisher":["Days of Wonder:1027","asmodee:157","Asterion Press:15889","Compaya.hu: Gamer Caf\u00E9 Kft.:14813","Edge Entertainment:2973","Enigma (Bergsala Enigma):6784","Gal\u00E1pagos Jogos:15605","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Hobby Japan:1391","Hobby World:18852","Lord of Boards:46500","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","Siam Board Games:33998","Stratelibri:3888"],"category":["Fantasy:1010","Fighting:1046","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Area Movement:2046","Dice Rolling:2072","Hidden Victory Points:2987","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources:2914","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897","Victory Points as a Resource:2874"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:55.5903971Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/42110/universal-head-small-world-rules-summary","title":"Universal Head SMALL WORLD Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/45605/small-world-faq","title":"Small World FAQ","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68917/small-world-almanac-reference-book-for-small-world","title":"Small World Almanac (Reference Book for Small World \u0026 Expansions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/61255/complete-overview-of-small-world-races-and-powers","title":"Complete overview of Small World Races \u0026 Powers, including Leaders rules \u0026 turn order aid, v.1.0","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/61395/rangerrobs-small-world-reference-sheet","title":"RangerRob\u0027s Small World Reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/52513/small-world-rules-summary-and-player-aid","title":"Small World Rules Summary and Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/47956/small-world-rules-summary","title":"Small World rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/205387/complete-small-world-reference-w-underground-and-a","title":"Complete Small World Reference (w/ Underground \u0026 All Expansions)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":318084,"name":"Furnace","year":2020,"description":"Furnace is an engine-building Eurogame in which players take on the roles of 19th-century capitalists building their industrial corporations and aspiring to make as much money as they can by purchasing companies, extracting resources, and processing them in the best combinations possible.\n\nEach player starts the game with a random start-up card, the resources depicted at the top of that card, and four colored discs valued 1-4.\n\nThe game is played over four rounds, and each round consists of two phases: Auction and Production. During the auction, 6-8 company cards are laid out with their basic sides face up. Players take turns placing one of their discs on one of these cards, but you cannot place a disc on a card if a disc of the same value or color is already present. Thus, you\u0027ll place discs on four cards.\n\nOnce all the discs are placed, the cards are resolved from left to right. Whoever placed the highest-valued disc will claim this card, but first anyone with a lower-valued disc on this card will gain compensation, either the resources depicted multiplied by the value of their disc or a processing ability (exchange X for Y) up to as many times as the value of their disc.\n\nOnce all the cards have been claimed or discarded, players enter the production phase, using their cards in the order of their choice. Each company card has one action \u0026mdash; either production or processing \u0026mdash; on its basic side and two actions on its upgraded side. During the production phase, you can use each of your cards once to gain resources, process those resources into other resources or money, and upgrade your cards.\n\nAt the end of four rounds, whoever has the most money wins.\n\nFurnace also includes capitalist cards that contain unique effects, and if you want, you can choose to deal one out to each player at the start of the game. For an additional challenge, you can require players to create a \u0022production chain\u0022, with each newly acquired company card being placed somewhere in that chain and locked in position for the remainder of the game.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":60,"avg_rating":738948,"rank":405,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7UK6bLlP0Cz3EFYCqhtcSw__original/img/jc4av13AOJpkqfvcpJ39HyoeCoM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5934958.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7UK6bLlP0Cz3EFYCqhtcSw__small/img/7WjwLTkySTiSMQu89ClZRhspd5Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5934958.png"],"designer":["Ivan Lashin:107002"],"artist":["Sergey Dulin:69037","Marta Ivanova:129809","Ilya Konovalov:129811","Vadim Poluboyarov:129808","Oleg Yurkov:129821","Egor Zharkov:129810"],"publisher":["Hobby World:18852","Arcane Wonders:17812","Board Game Rookie:44580","La Bo\u00EEte de Jeu:27121","CMON Global Limited:21608","DV Games:917","JELLY JELLY GAMES:31120","Jing Studio:44955","Jumping Turtle Games:25996","Kobold Spieleverlag:42145","Maldito Games:30677","Meeple King:54941","MeepleBR:32591","Midnight Jungle:48587","Vagabund:27947"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Economic:1021","Industry / Manufacturing:1088","Post-Napoleonic:2710"],"mechanic":["Action Queue:2689","Auction / Bidding:2012","Auction Compensation:3098","Auction: Fixed Placement:2931","Auction: Multiple Lot:2927","Constrained Bidding:2922","Income:2902","Multi-Use Cards:3099","Open Drafting:2041","Turn Order: Progressive:2828","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:55.5904531Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/207383/furnace-english-rules-publisher-edition","title":"Furnace \u2014 English Rules (Publisher edition)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/231973/condensed-furnace-setup-rules","title":"Condensed Furnace setup / rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/304044/furnace-condensed-rules","title":"Furnace Condensed Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Each player leads one of four armies: Borgo, Hegemonia (Hegemony), Moloch, and Posterunek (Outpost). Each army deck consists of 34 tiles: soldiers, support tiles, and special actions. You win when all enemy headquarters are destroyed or when your headquarters is the least damaged at the end of the game.\n\n\n     In 2007 and 2013, the game had graphical facelifts, somewhat modifying the iconography. Note: each army (whether base game or expansion) is compatible with every version (1.0, 2.x, 3.0). Only the art styles and icon graphics differ mildly.\n     The game had different editions with different components/bonuses alongside the 4 base armies (big board, bonus army, puzzles, etc.). See different editions for details.\n     Tile width and thickness strongly varied depending on edition, and even on a same editor slightly varied over the years. This does not affect play, but may affect some storage solutions.\n\n\n Due to multiple versions and expansions, see the Neuroshima Hex! english FAQ\n The game is also expanded by Unofficial Neuroshima Hex! expansions, available here on BGG.\n\nNote:  There is no solitaire bot/AI/system to compete against.

Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?\n\nIn Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 \u0022glory\u0022 points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there\u0027s some uncertainty about when the game will end.\n\nA big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn \u0022pirate\u0022 or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it\u0027s possible to come back from defeat.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":180,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":7386,"rank":410,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__original/img/wrLHO6mElyCGzog0aHzJ9KE-SeE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic738119.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__small/img/Rd6POAEmJOEtwKB7bSDTKPsL_9k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic738119.jpg"],"designer":["Kasper Aagaard:7627","Christian Marcussen:7614"],"artist":["Ben Nelson:9983","Chris Quilliams:14057"],"publisher":["Z-Man Games:538","asmodee:157","Asterion Press:15889","Conclave Editora:11043","Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Pegasus Spiele:39","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","White Goblin Games:4932"],"category":["Adventure:1022","Fighting:1046","Nautical:1008","Pike and Shot:2725","Pirates:1090","Transportation:1011"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Area Movement:2046","Bias:2957","Dice Rolling:2072","Events:2850","Pick-up and Deliver:2007","Race:2876","Variable Player Powers:2015","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:55.5905639Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/108797/merchants-and-marauders-solo-rules","title":"Merchants \u0026 Marauders - SOLO RULES","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/67193/the-esoteric-order-of-gamers-merchants-and-maraude","title":"The Esoteric Order of Gamers MERCHANTS \u0026 MARAUDERS Rules \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/61428/player-reference","title":"Player Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/163277/unofficial-expansion-colors-of-war","title":"Unofficial Expansion: Colors of War","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/69674/merchants-and-marauders-rules-summary","title":"Merchants \u0026 Marauders rules summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/64618/flatten-the-learning-curve-rules-summary","title":"Flatten the Learning Curve Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/68465/merchants-and-marauders-rules-in-12-point-type","title":"Merchants \u0026 Marauders, rules, in 12-point type","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/150859/combat-quick-reference","title":"Combat Quick Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":172818,"name":"Above and Below","year":2015,"description":"Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.\n\nThen you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.\n\nWith any luck, you\u0027ll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.\n\nAbove and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they\u0027ve been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?\n\nA great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You\u0027ll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you\u0027re willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.\n\nAt the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!\n\nThe Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:\n\n     Villager Tool tokens\n     Lost Villagers\n     Swamp Villagers\n     Exclusive Stretch goals:\n     Creature Villagers\n     Quest Tokens\n     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book\n     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book \n     Wooden Goods\n\n\nThis collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":90,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":734479,"rank":412,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0wpvRmBe65e4vwGf0Jbpg__original/img/gIlpowYQ7XzumYO0jZyVldxosBA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2398773.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0wpvRmBe65e4vwGf0Jbpg__small/img/jHLwKKWiJ-lHoaNIj0TrKAGm7QM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2398773.jpg"],"designer":["Ryan Laukat:11854"],"artist":["Ryan Laukat:11854"],"publisher":["Red Raven Games:18617","Arclight Games:3475","Bard Centrum Gier:9074","Conclave Editora:11043","Devir:2366","DV Games:917","Lavka Games:34801","Lucky Duck Games:33626","MYBG Co., Ltd.:23756","Mysterious Island Games:34963","Schwerkraft-Verlag:24844"],"category":["Adventure:1022","City Building:1029","Economic:1021","Exploration:1020","Fantasy:1010","Farming:1013","Negotiation:1026"],"mechanic":["Action Points:2001","Dice Rolling:2072","Narrative Choice / Paragraph:2851","Set Collection:2004","Storytelling:2027","Trading:2008","Turn Order: Progressive:2828"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:55.5906028Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/144760/above-and-below-solo-rules","title":"Above and Below Solo Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135635/rules-english-pdf","title":"Rules English (PDF)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/148833/player-guide","title":"Player Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/202277/above-and-below-automa-rules","title":"Above and Below Automa - rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/149680/above-and-below-quick-rules-guide","title":"Above and Below Quick Rules Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/194562/above-and-below-rules-in-brief","title":"Above and Below - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/312744/above-and-below-printable-player-aid","title":"Above and Below Printable Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180079/above-and-below-rules-summary-v10","title":"Above and Below Rules Summary v1.0","language":"English","file_type":"docx"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/305456/round-and-game-end-reference-tent","title":"Round- and Game-End Reference Tent","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

Outwit your opponent in a fascinating tactical duel in which having the best cards and playing them at the wrong time can be deadly for yourself.\n\nCards in Mindbug represent weird creatures that all come with unique and powerful abilities such as a Compost Dragon, a Snail Hydra, or a Kangasaurus Rex. Each player starts the game with ten creature cards (five in hand and five in a draw pile) and tries to use them to reduce the opponent\u0027s life total to zero. In addition, every player receives two Mindbug cards that can be used to mind control an opposing creature when it is played. This innovative Mindbug mechanism is the core of the game and leads to a unique decision-making process that makes Mindbug feel utterly different from any other card game.\n\nPlaying a card doesn\u0027t require any resources in Mindbug. As a result, the game has no ramp-up phase (such as gathering resources) and doesn\u0027t require weak cards. Since there is also no deck-building, you can start playing right away from a single deck. There is also no unfair advantage as players draw cards from the same deck and always get the chance to mind control the strongest opposing cards. In the end, it all comes down to your own decisions, making the game extremely fair and competitive at the same time.\n\n\u0026mdash;description from the publisher\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":15,"max_time":25,"avg_rating":757843,"rank":413,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b8gl6w-BqUVgBURdyFcFZg__original/img/chGo_gyJr418yMPchcWhLoW5AjQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7646386.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b8gl6w-BqUVgBURdyFcFZg__small/img/dCGADcFu3CrjHeao9JKibUHYUik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7646386.png"],"designer":["Skaff Elias:118","Richard Garfield:14","Marvin Hegen:139860","Christian Kudahl:139861"],"artist":["Denis Martynets:81719"],"publisher":["Nerdlab Games:49649","Devir:2366","GaGa Games:29194","Game Harbor:12540","G\u00E9m Klub Kft.:8820","Ghost Galaxy:52393","IELLO:8923","JELLY JELLY GAMES:31120","Lord of Boards:46500","Meanbook Games:48269","Pendragon Game Studio:27654","Portal Games:2726","REXhry:21053"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Fantasy:1010","Fighting:1046","Science Fiction:1016"],"mechanic":["Hand Management:2040","Take That:2686"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:55.5906289Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/228021/mindbug-official-rules","title":"Mindbug Official Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhauser for ranged attacks and area effects.\n\nThe game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that\u0027s brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":2,"min_time":20,"max_time":20,"avg_rating":789842,"rank":418,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Fr8QPIazZRgEMnN2bwJ0g__original/img/si2jJWDVMO-EGy-r0RR7aVjLtO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4621589.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Fr8QPIazZRgEMnN2bwJ0g__small/img/wAEIsSjKsEHg_JVJ_adV6MvsJ4o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4621589.jpg"],"designer":["Rob Daviau:442","Justin D.

There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.\n\nIn Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!\n\nFans of Sid Meier\u0026rsquo;s classic video game franchise will find familiar footing in Civilization: The Board Game. Staying true to the foundations of its video game predecessor while creating a new and unique way to play, Civilization: The Board Game captures the spirit and grandeur of carving out a magnificent empire from modest beginnings.\n\nPlayers start off with a single city, one army figure, and one scout, and from these meager origins you must forge through the ages and become the greatest civilization in the world.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the video game series will find Civilization: The Board Game a great way to enter into the world of Civilization. The strategy and tactical decisions involved in Civilization: The Board Game will appeal to strategy gamers and war gamers alike, and the ability to win through culture and technological advancement will give those who only wish to focus on their own empire a chance at victory as well.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":240,"avg_rating":737084,"rank":419,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1WAfWHPi4Vvm1UCMtQaeaA__original/img/R7C_Kxsq4KI8i7twszpT_kCQ--g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic798666.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1WAfWHPi4Vvm1UCMtQaeaA__small/img/2zIfpLPUFyuWfgqLTvtvrHa19Mg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic798666.jpg"],"designer":["Kevin Wilson:2336"],"artist":["Henning Ludvigsen:24858"],"publisher":["Fantasy Flight Games:17","ADC Blackfire Entertainment:23043","Delta Vision Publishing:6194","Edge Entertainment:2973","Fantasmagoria:22560","Galakta:4617","Giochi Uniti:5530","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby Japan:1391","Hobby World:18852","Korea Boardgames:8291","Stratelibri:3888","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234"],"category":["City Building:1029","Civilization:1015","Exploration:1020","Negotiation:1026","Video Game Theme:1101"],"mechanic":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building:2664","Grid Movement:2676","Hand Management:2040","Modular Board:2011","Open Drafting:2041","Rock-Paper-Scissors:2003","Square Grid:2940","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks:2849","Trading:2008","Variable Player Powers:2015"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:55.5907937Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/63131/universal-headesoteric-order-of-gamers-sid-meiers","title":"Universal Head/Esoteric Order of Gamers SID MEIER\u0027S CIVILIZATION: THE BOARD GAME Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/98422/civilization-summary-of-official-and-unofficial-ru","title":"Civilization : Summary of Official and Unofficial Rules about main issues","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93869/illustrated-tech-reference-updated-for-wisdom-and","title":"Illustrated Tech Reference (Updated for Wisdom and Warfare)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/79752/civilization-solo-rules-v04","title":"Civilization - Solo rules v0.4","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/97725/updated-reference-sheet-and-player-aid-for-use-for","title":"Updated reference sheet \u0026 player aid for use for both expansions.","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/94093/civ-tbg-culture-card-reference-v2","title":"Civ TBG Culture Card Reference (v2)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93875/great-person-reference-updated-for-wisdom-and-warf","title":"Great Person Reference (Updated for Wisdom and Warfare)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/133727/rule-book-attemptive-3rd-expansion-for-sid-miere-c","title":"[Rule book] Attemptive 3rd Expansion for Sid Miere Civilization the Board Game","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/181120/civ2010-ai-player-rules","title":"Civ2010 AI player rules","language":"English","file_type":"unknown"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/62454/fantasy-flight-civilization-setup-rules-reference","title":"Fantasy Flight _Civilization_ - Setup Rules - reference","language":"English","file_type":"doc"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":176920,"name":"Mission: Red Planet (Second/Third Edition)","year":2015,"description":"With technology rapidly developing and the human population growing, Victorian-era Earth is in dire need of fuel, land, and other natural resources. Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.\n\nAs the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy \u0026ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet\u0027s most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.\n\nIn each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they\u0027ll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game\u0027s end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.\n\nThe 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:\n\n\n    Components for up to six players instead of five\n    Special two-player variant rules\n    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards\n    Mars\u0027 moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself\n\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":45,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":738834,"rank":420,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dqA_FWqa16taFKOqvdvCEA__original/img/H-cOJQRUO5I_LuDx1EaMcPi-3JU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8483896.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dqA_FWqa16taFKOqvdvCEA__small/img/tv2UwUf9pKFHQKY7utSSq7xk9tI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8483896.jpg"],"designer":["Bruno Cathala:1727","Bruno Faidutti:125"],"artist":["Andrew Bosley:40597","Samuel R.

Habitable space is scarce, however, and mankind must now face the challenge of building ever upwards. To develop this new type of city, you will gather a team of experts around you, and try to become the best urban planner for Ginkgopolis.\n\nIn  Ginkgopolis, the city tiles come in three colors: yellow, which provides victory points; red, which provides resources; and blue, which provides new city tiles. Some tiles start in play, and they\u0027re surrounded by letter markers that show where new tiles can be placed.\n\nBegin with three Character cards which grant you starting resources and bonuses to power your game actions. On a turn, each player chooses a Construction or Urbanization card from his hand simultaneously. Players reveal these cards, adding new tiles to the border of the city in the appropriate location or placing tiles on top of existing tiles. Each card in your hand that you don\u0027t play is passed on to your left-hand neighbor, so keep in mind how your play might set up theirs!\n\nWhen you build over a tile, you add its \u0026ldquo;power\u0022 card to your tableau, which provides you additional abilities during the game, allowing you to scale up your building and point-scoring efforts.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":5,"min_time":45,"max_time":45,"avg_rating":748606,"rank":421,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2y2A4qcoGamLcYNLv8wb5A__original/img/tC1u-idEJeuZui-n806S9nw3oPI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5975231.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2y2A4qcoGamLcYNLv8wb5A__small/img/U27Rs0NzKCs5s6V5CeA-fw5e4Lc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5975231.jpg"],"designer":["Xavier Georges:11312"],"artist":["Ga\u00EBl Lannurien:63617"],"publisher":["Pearl Games:12884","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby Japan:1391","SD Games:33010","uplay.it edizioni:17786","Z-Man Games:538"],"category":["City Building:1029","Environmental:1084","Science Fiction:1016","Territory Building:1086"],"mechanic":["Area Majority / Influence:2080","Closed Drafting:2984","End Game Bonuses:2875","Hand Management:2040","Income:2902","Layering:3001","Modular Board:2011","Simultaneous Action Selection:2020","Solo / Solitaire Game:2819","Square Grid:2940","Tile Placement:2002","Turn Order: Progressive:2828"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:58.429697Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/88284/gameplay-and-rules-summary","title":"Gameplay and Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/99524/ginkgopolis-player-aid-and-setup-guide","title":"Ginkgopolis Player Aid and Setup Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/189442/ginkgopolis-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Ginkgopolis - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/257937/a-more-thematic-and-teachable-rulebook","title":"A more thematic and teachable rulebook","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/280774/ginkgopolis-rules-in-brief","title":"Ginkgopolis - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

One player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The other players are police detectives who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game. The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel\u0027s streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"min_time":90,"max_time":90,"avg_rating":73327,"rank":422,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H3G1t-oIjN9gEVVI21FoVg__original/img/YfHGqQB_HXicZUTY-XgXgpsl_rg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1545654.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H3G1t-oIjN9gEVVI21FoVg__small/img/f6VZ_PEr1DAr6oLEjG9PxGFYzmQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1545654.jpg"],"designer":["Gabriele Mari:8540","Gianluca Santopietro:10052"],"artist":["Gianluca Santopietro:10052"],"publisher":["Nexus Editrice:504","Sir Chester Cobblepot:18942","999 Games:267","asmodee:157","Devir:2366","Don\u0027t Panic Games:27389","Edge Entertainment:2973","Elznir Games:54932","Fantasy Flight Games:17","Galakta:4617","Giochi Uniti:5530","Heidelberger Spieleverlag:264","Hobby Japan:1391","Korea Boardgames:8291","Planplay:14346","Stratelibri:3888","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.:9234","Zhiyanjia:35809"],"category":["Bluffing:1023","Deduction:1039","Murder / Mystery:1040","Post-Napoleonic:2710"],"mechanic":["Hidden Movement:2967","Memory:2047","Point to Point Movement:2078","Questions and Answers:3102","Secret Unit Deployment:2016","Team-Based Game:2019"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:58.429739Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/132339/universal-head-letters-from-whitechapel-rules-summ","title":"Universal Head LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL Rules Summary \u0026 Reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/75921/whitechapeltm-letters-from-hell-english-rules-11","title":"Whitechapel\u2122 Letters from Hell - english rules 1.1","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80211/quick-reference-rules","title":"Quick Reference Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/221147/letters-from-whitechapel-diagram-for-rules","title":"Letters from Whitechapel: diagram for rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":297030,"name":"Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun","year":2020,"description":"Four millennia ago on the eastern bank of the Nile river was laid the foundation of the Temple of Amun-Ra. Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as \u0022The Most Select of Places\u0022 (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.\n\nJoin ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.\n\nThe game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun\u0027s rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.\n\nThe game takes place over multiple rounds. Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk\u0027s shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.\n\nAs you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice \u0026mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section \u0026mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.\n\nWhen you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!\n\nTwo scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.\n\n","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"min_time":60,"max_time":120,"avg_rating":766595,"rank":423,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__original/img/jEL4WHl98vZHaZFcw9hDXxsxjSo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5313583.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__small/img/QaUXxrgmXFrlNADgPeGhY5F538g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5313583.jpg"],"designer":["Daniele Tascini:59986","D\u00E1vid Turczi:76227"],"artist":["Micha\u0142 D\u0142ugaj:117486","Jakub Fajtanowski:112276","Zbigniew Umgelter:86237","Aleksander Zawada:129439"],"publisher":["Board\u0026Dice:26630","BoardM Factory:25074","CMON Global Limited:21608","CrowD Games:34522","Giant Roc:42147","Giochix.it:7251","Maldito Games:30677","Mosaico Jogos:44349","Pixie Games:30034","Portal Games:2726","Rawstone:45510"],"category":["Ancient:1050","Dice:1017","Mythology:1082"],"mechanic":["Action Drafting:2838","Income:2902","Open Drafting:2041","Pattern Building:2048","Turn Order: Stat-Based:2826","Variable Set-up:2897"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:58.4297617Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/198963/official-rules","title":"Official Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/272395/action-andy-tekhenu-with-expansions-complete-compa","title":"ACTION ANDY - TEKHENU with expansions Complete Compact Rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/208712/tekhenu-rules-reference-and-player-aid","title":"Tekhenu - Rules Reference \u0026 Player Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/224004/tekhenu-obelisk-of-the-sun-complete-rules-summary","title":"Tekhenu Obelisk of the Sun - Complete rules summary EN","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

As you play, the game keeps track of your actions and decisions. Your characters will grow in power, collecting new items, weapons, and skills. NPCs and locations will change, depending on how you interact with them. All of this progression is done using a simple, but powerful, index system, which allows for quick and easy set-up and tear down.\n\n\n\n    Combat \u0026mdash; Arydia features a tactical, co-operative combat system. Enemies are controlled by game cards and dice, while you and your companions work together to defeat them.\n\n\n\n    Role-playing \u0026mdash; Take on the roles of a wide cast of characters as you encounter them throughout your journeys.

{"bgg_id":140934,"name":"Arboretum","year":2015,"description":"Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes. Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.\n\nThe deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.\n\nWhen the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn\u0027t have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":30,"max_time":30,"avg_rating":724737,"rank":425,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__original/img/RMi0pEsP8agfH-tgYkeRGilD3oo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4172124.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__small/img/X6V1M2nZOinTgwE0KIBfup_QrCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4172124.png"],"designer":["Dan Cassar:53889"],"artist":["Philippe Gu\u00E9rin:74074","Chris Quilliams:14057","Beth Sobel:71164"],"publisher":["Filosofia \u00C9ditions:5657","Renegade Game Studios:28072","Z-Man Games:538","ABACUSSPIELE:29","Banana Games:35928","Conclave Editora:11043","Fractal Juegos:33618","Gen-X Games:8351","Korea Boardgames:8291","Lavka Games:34801","MIPL:51614","Raven Distribution:3242","Rebel Sp. z o.o.:7466","TLAMA games:41423","Vagabund:27947","WoodCat:47883"],"category":["Card Game:1002","Number:1098"],"mechanic":["Connections:2883","Hand Management:2040","Move Through Deck:2962","Open Drafting:2041","Ordering:3101","Pattern Building:2048","Set Collection:2004","Square Grid:2940"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:58.4298047Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/137835/arboretum-a-plain-and-simple-guide","title":"Arboretum - A Plain and Simple Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/165094/english-rules-for-arboretum-from-renegade-game-stu","title":"English rules for Arboretum from Renegade Game Studios","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/243438/unofficial-solo-rules-by-ricky-royal","title":"Unofficial SOLO RULES by Ricky Royal","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/168665/official-rules-for-arboretum-searchable","title":"Official Rules for Arboretum (Searchable)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193920/arboretum-rules-in-brief","title":"Arboretum - rules in brief","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/231722/arboretum-card-sized-rules-and-scoring-aid","title":"Arboretum Card Sized Rules and Scoring Aid","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/144971/ita-arboretum-rules-part1","title":"[ITA] Arboretum_Rules (part1)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/252665/rules-reference-sheets","title":"Rules Reference Sheets","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}

{"bgg_id":40354,"name":"Maria","year":2009,"description":"Maria is a game based on the War of the Austrian Succession, between 1740 and 1748, where Austria was attacked by Prussia, France, Bavaria and Saxony, while only Great Britain, Hanover and the Netherlands (by forming the so-called Pragmatic Army) helped her.\n\nMaria is primarily a 3 player game. One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria\u0027s enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria\u0027s ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.\n\nMaria is derived from the award-winning Friedrich: Anniversary Edition, but has its very own character, including politics, hussars, force marches, imperial election, Saxony\u0027s betrayal and Prussia\u0027s annexation of Silesia. Subtle maneuvers, seizure of fortresses, prudent retreats, and Machiavellian politics are the keys to victory. However, players must be careful: whoever uses his Tactical Cards unwisely in battle can suddenly find himself not on the highway to glory but on the road to ruin.\n\nMaria takes you to the era of the 18th century\u0027s ruthless struggle for power. It can be played in 2 variants: the shorter, simplified introductory game or the longer but richer advanced game, with its simultaneous campaigns in Bohemia and Flanders.\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":3,"min_time":210,"max_time":210,"avg_rating":799384,"rank":428,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RKnoGhSQwVQo0Z_pXTE19g__original/img/taWfpVHP0yyEzNXQiIGkPwLCuLM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic524669.jpg","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RKnoGhSQwVQo0Z_pXTE19g__small/img/n-5E6_QWWDbxynAo4gqUvgMk2RE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic524669.jpg"],"designer":["Richard Siv\u00E9l:4034"],"artist":["Hans Baltzer:20523","Richard Shako:51410","Richard Stubenvoll:20525","Andreas T\u00F6pfer:12381"],"publisher":["Histogame:1629"],"category":["Age of Reason:2726","Bluffing:1023","Negotiation:1026","Political:1001","Wargame:1019"],"mechanic":["Auction / Bidding:2012","Hand Management:2040","Negotiation:2915","Point to Point Movement:2078","Secret Unit Deployment:2016","Simulation:2070","Tug of War:2888","Variable Set-up:2897","Zone of Control:2974"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:58.4299294Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/47356/maria-english-rulespdf","title":"Maria English Rules.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/84868/rangerrobs-maria-intro-game-reference-and-army-she","title":"RangerRob\u0027s Maria Intro Game Reference and Army Sheets","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/86809/one-page-summary-rules-20","title":"One-page summary (rules 2.0)","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/72173/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/98167/1-page-summary-of-maria-rules","title":"1-page summary of Maria rules","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/121746/maria-complete-rules-summary","title":"Maria Complete Rules Summary","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/54314/maria-vassal-user-guide","title":"Maria - Vassal User Guide","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/173740/maria-condensed-rules-by-mnmdd","title":"Maria Condensed Rules by MNMDD","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/123190/mariafriedrich-key-differences-quick-reference-she","title":"Maria/Friedrich Key Differences ~ Quick reference Sheet","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93610/maria-hebrew-rules-mryh-hvravt-b-bryt","title":"Maria - Hebrew rules - \u05DE\u05E8\u05D9\u05D4  \u05D4\u05D5\u05E8\u05D0\u05D5\u05EA \u05D1\u05E2\u05D1\u05E8\u05D9\u05EA ","language":"English","file_type":"docx"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
{"bgg_id":13122,"name":"Antiquity","year":2004,"description":"From the Manufacturer:\n\n\u0022These fields no longer yield grain the way they used to,\u0022 complains the farmer. \u0022We should settle new lands before our food runs out. Why don\u0027t we start farming olives, like our neighbors?\u0022\n\nThe cart-driver nods: \u0022Ever since them city folks started worshiping San Giorgio I have to travel further and further to new building sites. I\u0027m on my way now to the new inn they built. I\u0027ll change horses there and deliver this load,\u0022 he gestures towards the pile of wood in the cart with his head \u0022to the sea beyond. Gonna start some fisheries there. It is said we\u0027ll conquer those olive-farmers before long. But their land is even more polluted than ours.\u0022\n\nThe farmer nods his head in reply. As the cart starts moving again, he returns to the field to harvest the last bushels of grain, growing between the stumps of what used to be a lush forest -- three turns ago.\n\nAntiquity is a strategy game for 2-4 players. It is set in an environment loosely modeled on Italy in the late Middle Ages. Players choose their own victory condition: they can focus on population growth, trade, conquest, or city building by choosing their patron saint.\n\nEach strategy requires a completely different style of play. Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all -- but you\u0027ll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player.\n\nWhile your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials -- until finally, there is no more land left to farm. Let\u0027s hope one of you has won the game before that time!\n\n","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_time":120,"max_time":180,"avg_rating":783117,"rank":429,"image_url":["https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CDORbD8KPxSXBaJrdHtN2Q__original/img/HrJb-K0d3SXsJfACbpsOiv6Lutc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3731052.png","https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CDORbD8KPxSXBaJrdHtN2Q__small/img/msitlnovDr7wZinoLdFSBFTLMiA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3731052.png"],"designer":["Jeroen Doumen:270","Joris Wiersinga:407"],"artist":["Ynze Moedt:12602"],"publisher":["Splotter Spellen:140"],"category":["City Building:1029","Civilization:1015","Economic:1021","Environmental:1084","Medieval:1035"],"mechanic":["Grid Coverage:2978","Hexagon Grid:2026","Modular Board:2011","Square Grid:2940","Tile Placement:2002","Trading:2008"],"scraped_at":"2026-01-24T18:46:58.4299486Z","rulebook_urls":[{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/7224/antiquity-rulespdf","title":"Antiquity Rules.pdf","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/33816/antiquity-solo-rules-english","title":"Antiquity Solo Rules, English","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/10848/antiquity-rules-overviewdoc","title":"antiquity rules overview.doc","language":"English","file_type":"doc"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/84728/antiquity-buildings-reference","title":"Antiquity buildings reference","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/74177/concise-reference-sheet-by-hecose","title":"concise reference sheet by hecose","language":"English","file_type":"pdf"},{"url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/26180/antiquity-reglas-en-castellanodoc","title":"Antiquity reglas en castellano.doc","language":"English","file_type":"doc"}],"name_vi":null,"description_vi":null,"category_vi":null,"mechanic_vi":null}
